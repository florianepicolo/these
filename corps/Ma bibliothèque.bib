	abstract = {The evolutionary history of vertebrates is marked by three ancient whole-genome duplications: two successive rounds in the ancestor of vertebrates, and a third one speciﬁc to teleost ﬁshes. Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for speciﬁc genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebraﬁsh and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in nonrenewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse porte sur l'histoire évolutive des gènes de vertébrés. Deux types de phénomènes évolutifs peuvent perturber l’organisation des gènes dans les génomes eucaryotes : les modifications du contenu en gènes des génomes par duplications ou délétions de gènes, et les changements dans l’ordre des gènes par réarrangements. L’impact fonctionnel et sélectif de ces processus sur les génomes est encore mal connu.Ce travail de thèse s’articule autour de trois projets portant sur les événements de duplication et de délétion qui modifient le nombre de copies d'un gène. Nous nous sommes intéressés à ces événements à partir d’arbres phylogénétiques reconstruits à l’échelle de génomes entiers. Dans une première partie nous avons examiné le cas où ces événements seraient sous sélection négative, en étudiant les arbres de gènes ou aucune duplication ou délétion ne s'est fixée. Nous avons observé que ces gènes avaient des propriétés particulières et nous proposons des hypothèses pour les expliquer. Dans une deuxième partie nous nous sommes intéressés aux duplications de gènes et aux corrélations que l'on observe avec l'évolution des fonctions biologiques. Enfin en dernière partie nous avons étudié en détail la famille de gènes ROBO dont une des copies aurait acquis une fonction différente dans le développement du système nerveux des mammifères sous l’influence de la sélection positive. Dans leur ensemble ces résultats apportent de nouveaux éléments pour mesurer et comprendre l’impact global des contraintes ou des avantages que les duplications de gènes en particulier, et le changement du nombre de copies des gènes en général, peuvent exercer sur un génome de vertébré.},

	abstract = {L'évolution moléculaire, basée sur l'étude des données de séquençage, s'est imposée comme une approche majeure pour l'étude de l'Histoire des organismes vivants (notamment à travers les arbres phylogénétiques). Ses méthodes classiques reposent sur un découpage des génomes en entités supposées indépendantes : les gènes. Or, les gènes n'évoluent pas indépendamment : au sein de l'histoire des espèces qui le portent, l'histoire d'un gène s'inscrit. En outre, leur position le long des chromosomes fait qu'ils partagent des événements de mutations structurales (duplications, pertes de fragments chromosomiques) avec les gènes proches. Enfin, leur potentielle fonction biologique les amène à être influencés par (et à influencer en retour) l'évolution d'autres gènes. Je montre que ne pas prendre en compte ces relations d'inter-dépendances évolutives (de coévolution) lors de l'inférence d'arbres de gènes résulte en une suresti mation des différences entre les arbres des différents gènes ainsi qu'entre les arbres des gènes et l'arbre des espèces. Des modèles permettent déjà d'intégrer la coévolution des gènes avec les espèces à la reconstruction des arbres de gènes. Par ailleurs, on connaît des modèles décrivant l'évolution des relations entre gènes, néanmoins sans intégrer ces informations à la reconstruction des arbres de gènes. Je reprends ces avancées et les combine au sein d'une méthode qui modifie les arbres de gènes selon un critère qui prend en compte les séquences ainsi que des relations de coévolution avec les espèces et d'autres gènes. Cette méthode, appliquée à des mammifères et des champignons, permet de produire des histoires de gènes cohérentes entre elles},

Les plus fréquents sont les inversions, les translocations réciproques, les fissions et les fusions de chromosomes. Pour étudier ces évènements nous avons premièrement développé une méthode, Phyldiag, qui, à partir de l'ordre des gènes dans les génomes modernes, identifie les segments de chromosomes qui ont été conservés sans être cassé par les réarrangements. Dans un deuxième temps nous avons développé Magsimus, un simulateur réaliste qui fait évoluer in silico un génome ancestral artificiel en lui faisant subir des réarrangements chromosomiques ainsi que des évènements géniques : des duplications, des naissances de novo et des délétions de gènes. Avec ce simulateur nous avons tenté de reproduire des évolutions équivalentes à l'évolution réelle qui, à partir d'un ancêtre commun vivant il y a environ 325 million d'années, a abouti à l'humain, la souris, le chien, l'opossum et le poulet. Nous avons utilisé les segments conservés entre les espèces réelles pour calculer une première estimation des nombres de réarrangements le long des branches de l'arbre des espèces. En comparant les génomes modernes simulés aux génomes modernes réels nous avons quantifié le réalisme de ce paramétrage initial puis nous l'avons affiné par une procédure d'optimisation, ce qui nous a simultanément permis d'estimer une distribution des tailles des inversions.

This lack of correlation is often referred to as 'Peto's Paradox'. Here, we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and that the increase in TP53 copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore, we show that several of the TP53 retrogenes (TP53RTGs) are transcribed and likely translated. While TP53RTGs do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of TP53 may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Peto's paradox in Proboscideans.},

Promising candidates can be found among compounds involved in signal transduction pathways, most notably protein kinases (mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] and phosphatidylinositol-3 protein kinase[PI3]) and transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa B [NF-jB], activating protein 1 [AP-1], CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein [C/EBP], and signal transducer and activator of transcription [Stat]). Inhibition of signal transduction pathways may be achievable via three main strategies: pharmacological inhibitors, anti-sense oligonucleotides or other relatively speciﬁc inhibitors, and induced overexpression of naturally occurring inhibitors. Clinical trials are under way to evaluate pharmacological inhibitors such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Although the preliminary results are promising, proof of safety has not yet been obtained.

Comparison with other vertebrates and a urochordate indicates that fish proteins have diverged markedly faster than their mammalian homologues. Comparison with the human genome suggests approximately 900 previously unannotated human genes. Analysis of the Tetraodon and human genomes shows that whole-genome duplication occurred in the teleost fish lineage, subsequent to its divergence from mammals. The analysis also makes it possible to infer the basic structure of the ancestral bony vertebrate genome, which was composed of 12 chromosomes, and to reconstruct much of the evolutionary history of ancient and recent chromosome rearrangements leading to the modern human karyotype.},

We identified a group of genes that have undergone dosage selection, accounting for 5\% of the total 11,444 ohnolog pairs. We also identified 306 putative sub/neo-functionalized ohnolog pairs that are likely to be under cell-type-specific genetic variation at single-cell resolution. Diversification in the expression patterns of several ohnolog pairs was observed in the retinal cell subpopulations. The single-cell level transcriptome analysis in this study uncovered the early stages of evolution in retinal cell of goldfish after WGD.

No extensive gene losses are observed in either subgenome. Instead, we find gene expression bias across surveyed tissues such that subgenome B is more dominant in homoeologous expression.

	abstract = {Teleost fishes are ancient tetraploids descended from an ancestral whole-genome duplication that may have contributed to the impressive diversification of this clade. Whole-genome duplications can occur via self-doubling (autopolyploidy) or via hybridization between different species (allopolyploidy). The mode of tetraploidization conditions evolutionary processes by which duplicated genomes return to diploid meiotic pairing, and subsequent genetic divergence of duplicated genes (cytological and genetic rediploidization). How teleosts became tetraploid remains unresolved, leaving a fundamental gap in the interpretation of their functional evolution. As a result of the whole-genome duplication, identifying orthologous and paralogous genomic regions across teleosts is challenging, hindering genome-wide investigations into their polyploid history. Here, we combine tailored gene phylogeny methodology together with a state-of-the-art ancestral karyotype reconstruction to establish the first high-resolution comparative atlas of paleopolyploid regions across 74 teleost genomes. We then leverage this atlas to investigate how rediploidization occurred in teleosts at the genome-wide level. We uncover that some duplicated regions maintained tetraploidy for more than 60 million years, with three chromosome pairs diverging genetically only after the separation of major teleost families. This evidence suggests that the teleost ancestor was an autopolyploid. Further, we find evidence for biased gene retention along several duplicated chromosomes, contradicting current paradigms that asymmetrical evolution is specific to allopolyploids. Altogether, our results offer novel insights into genome evolutionary dynamics following ancient polyploidizations in vertebrates.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-9-202},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: NLRPs (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine rich Repeat and Pyrin domain containing Proteins) are members of NLR (Nod-like receptors) protein family. Recent researches have shown that NLRP genes play important roles in both mammalian innate immune system and reproductive system. Several of NLRP genes were shown to be specifically expressed in the oocyte in mammals. The aim of the present work was to study how these genes evolved and diverged after their duplication, as well as whether natural selection played a role during their evolution.
RESULTS: By using in silico methods, we have evaluated the evolution and functional divergence of NLRP genes, in particular of mouse reproduction-related Nlrp genes. We found that (1) major NLRP genes have been duplicated before the divergence of mammals, with certain lineage-specific duplications in primates (NLRP7 and 11) and in rodents (Nlrp1, 4 and 9 duplicates); (2) tandem duplication events gave rise to a mammalian reproduction-related NLRP cluster including NLRP2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14 genes; (3) the function of mammalian oocyte-specific NLRP genes (NLRP4, 5, 9 and 14) might have diverged during gene evolution; (4) recent segmental duplications concerning Nlrp4 copies and vomeronasal 1 receptor encoding genes (V1r) have been undertaken in the mouse; and (5) duplicates of Nlrp4 and 9 in the mouse might have been subjected to adaptive evolution.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study brings us novel information on the evolution of mammalian reproduction-related NLRPs. On the one hand, NLRP genes duplicated and functionally diversified in mammalian reproductive systems (such as NLRP4, 5, 9 and 14). On the other hand, during evolution, different lineages adapted to develop their own NLRP genes, particularly in reproductive function (such as the specific expansion of Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 in the mouse).},

He reiterated this point a few years later in proposing that without duplicated genes the creation of metazoans, vertebrates, and mammals from unicellular organisms would have been impossible. Such big leaps in evolution, he argued, required the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions. Bold statements such as these, combined with his proposal that at least one whole-genome duplication event facilitated the evolution of vertebrates, have made Ohno an icon in the literature on genome evolution. However, discussion on the occurrence and consequences of gene and genome duplication events has a much longer, and often neglected, history. Here we review literature dealing with the occurrence and consequences of gene duplication, beginning in 1911. We document conceptual and technological advances in gene duplication research from this early research in comparative cytology up to recent research on whole genomes, "transcriptomes," and "interactomes."},

In budding yeast, extracellular glucose and a plethora of signals related with growth and stress conditions regulate the intracellular cAMP levels that modulate PKA activity which in turn regulates a broad range of cellular processes. The cAMP-PKA signaling output requires a controlled specificity of the PKA responses.

If so, there are two consequences: first, both underexpression and overexpression of protein complex subunits should lower fitness, and second, the accuracy of transcriptional co-regulation of subunits should reflect the deleterious consequences of imbalance. Here we show that all these predictions are upheld in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This supports the hypothesis2,3 that dominance is a by-product of physiology and metabolism rather than the result of selection to mask the deleterious effects of mutations. Beyond this, single-gene duplication of protein subunits is expected to be harmful, as this, too, leads to imbalance. As then expected, we find that members of large gene families are rarely involved in complexes. The balance hypothesis therefore provides a single theoretical framework for understanding components both of dominance and of gene family size.},

Some of them (ZP3, ADAM1, ADAM2, ACR and CD9) have individually been shown to evolve under positive selection [3], [4], suggesting a role of positive Darwinian selection on sperm-egg interaction. However, the genes involved in this biological function have not been systematically and exhaustively studied with an evolutionary perspective, in particular across vertebrates with internal and external fertilization. Here we show that 33 genes among the 69 that have been experimentally shown to be involved in fertilization in at least one taxon in vertebrates are under positive selection. Moreover, we identified 17 pseudogenes and 39 genes that have at least one duplicate in one species. For 15 genes, we found neither positive selection, nor gene copies or pseudogenes. Genes of teleosts, especially genes involved in sperm-oolemma fusion, appear to be more frequently under positive selection than genes of birds and eutherians. In contrast, pseudogenization, gene loss and gene gain are more frequent in eutherians. Thus, each of the 19 studied vertebrate species exhibits a unique signature characterized by gene gain and loss, as well as position of amino acids under positive selection. Reflecting these clade-specific signatures, teleosts and eutherian mammals are recovered as clades in a parsimony analysis. Interestingly the same analysis places Xenopus apart from teleosts, with which it shares the primitive external fertilization, and locates it along with amniotes (which share internal fertilization), suggesting that external or internal environmental conditions of germ cell interaction may not be the unique factors that drive the evolution of fertilization genes. Our work should improve our understanding of the fertilization process and on the establishment of reproductive barriers, for example by offering new leads for experiments on genes identified as positively selected.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: SAL1 (salivary lipocalin) is a member of the OBP (Odorant Binding Protein) family and is involved in chemical sexual communication in pig. SAL1 and its relatives may be involved in pheromone and olfactory receptor binding and in pre-mating behaviour. The evolutionary history and the selective pressures acting on SAL1 and its orthologous genes have not yet been exhaustively described. The aim of the present work was to study the evolution of these genes, to elucidate the role of selective pressures in their evolution and the consequences for their functions.
RESULTS: Here, we present the evolutionary history of SAL1 gene and its orthologous genes in mammals. We found that (1) SAL1 and its related genes arose in eutherian mammals with lineage-specific duplications in rodents, horse and cow and are lost in human, mouse lemur, bushbaby and orangutan, (2) the evolution of duplicated genes of horse, rat, mouse and guinea pig is driven by concerted evolution with extensive gene conversion events in mouse and guinea pig and by positive selection mainly acting on paralogous genes in horse and guinea pig, (3) positive selection was detected for amino acids involved in pheromone binding and amino acids putatively involved in olfactory receptor binding, (4) positive selection was also found for lineage, indicating a species-specific strategy for amino acid selection.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides new insights into the evolutionary history of SAL1 and its orthologs. On one hand, some genes are subject to concerted evolution and to an increase in dosage, suggesting the need for homogeneity of sequence and function in certain species. On the other hand, positive selection plays a role in the diversification of the functions of the family and in lineage, suggesting adaptive evolution, with possible consequences for speciation and for the reinforcement of prezygotic barriers.},

	abstract = {About 30\% of protein-coding genes in the human genome are related through two whole genome duplication (WGD) events. Although WGD is often credited with great evolutionary importance, the processes governing the retention of these genes and their biological significance remain unclear. One increasingly popular hypothesis is that dosage balance constraints are a major determinant of duplicate gene retention. We test this hypothesis and show that WGD-duplicated genes (ohnologs) have rarely experienced subsequent small-scale duplication (SSD) and are also refractory to copy number variation (CNV) in human populations and are thus likely to be sensitive to relative quantities (i.e., they are dosage-balanced). By contrast, genes that have experienced SSD in the vertebrate lineage are more likely to also display CNV. This supports the hypothesis of biased retention of dosage-balanced genes after WGD. We also show that ohnologs have a strong association with human disease. In particular, Down Syndrome (DS) caused by trisomy 21 is widely assumed to be caused by dosage effects, and 75\% of previously reported candidate genes for this syndrome are ohnologs that experienced no other copy number changes. We propose the remaining dosage-balanced ohnologs on chromosome 21 as candidate DS genes. These observations clearly show a persistent resistance to dose changes in genes duplicated by WGD. Dosage balance constraints simultaneously explain duplicate gene retention and essentiality after WGD.},

Here we present a high-quality genome assembly for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and show that large genomic reorganizations, coinciding with bursts of transposon-mediated repeat expansions, were crucial for the post-Ss4R rediploidization process. Comparisons of duplicate gene expression patterns across a wide range of tissues with orthologous genes from a pre-Ss4R outgroup unexpectedly demonstrate far more instances of neofunctionalization than subfunctionalization. Surprisingly, we find that genes that were retained as duplicates after the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication 320 million years ago were not more likely to be retained after the Ss4R, and that the duplicate retention was not influenced to a great extent by the nature of the predicted protein interactions of the gene products. Finally, we demonstrate that the Atlantic salmon assembly can serve as a reference sequence for the study of other salmonids for a range of purposes.},

	abstract = {Gene dosage is an important issue both in cell and evolutionary biology. Most genes are present in two copies or alleles in diploid eukariotic cells. The most outstanding exception is monoallelic gene expression (MA) that concerns genes localized on the X chromosome or in regions undergoing parental imprinting in eutherians, and many other genes scattered throughout the genome. In diploids, haploinsufficiency (HI) implies that a single functional copy of a gene in a diploid organism is insufficient to ensure a normal biological function. One of the most important mechanisms ensuring functional innovation during evolution is whole genome duplication (WGD). In addition to the two WGDs that have occurred in vertebrate genomes, the teleost genomes underwent an additional WGD, after their divergence from tetrapods. In the present work, we have studied on 57 teleost species whether the orthologs of human MA or HI genes remain more frequently in duplicates or returned more frequently in singleton than the rest of the genome. Our results show that the teleost orthologs of HI human genes remained more frequently in duplicate than the rest of the genome in all of the teleost species studied. No signal was observed for the orthologs of genes mapping to the human X chromosome or subjected to parental imprinting. Surprisingly, the teleost orthologs of the other human MA genes remained in duplicate more frequently than the rest of the genome for most teleost species. These results suggest that the teleost orthologs of MA and HI human genes also undergo selective pressures either related to absolute protein amounts and/or of dosage balance issues. However, these constraints seem to be different for MA genes in teleost in comparison with human genomes.},

	abstract = {Signaling through ligand/receptor interactions is a widespread mechanism across all living taxa. During evolution, however, there has been a diversification in multigene families and changes in their interaction patterns. Among the events that led to the creation of new genes is the whole-genome duplication, which made possible some major innovations. Teleost fishes descended from a common ancestor which underwent one such whole-genome duplication. In our study, we investigated the effect of complete genome duplication on the evolution of ligand-receptor pairs in teleosts. We selected ten teleost species and used bioinformatics programs and phylogenetic tools in order to study the evolution of the human ligands and receptors that have orthologous genes in fishes, as well as the rest of the fish genomes. We established that since the complete duplication of the fish genomes, the conservation in duplicate copy of ligand and receptor genes is higher than expected. However, the ligand/receptor pair partners did not necessarily evolve in the same way, and a lot of situations occurred in which one of the partners returned in singleton copy when the other one was maintained in duplicate. This suggests that changes in interaction partners may have taken place during the evolution of teleosts. Moreover, the fate of the ligands and receptor coding genes is partly congruent with the phylogeny of teleosts. However, some incongruences can be observed. We suggest that these incongruences are correlated to the environment.},

	abstract = {Controversy surrounds the apparent rising maximums of morphological complexity during eukaryotic evolution, with organisms increasing the number and nestedness of developmental areas as evidenced by morphological elaborations reflecting area boundaries. No “predictable drive” to increase this sort of complexity has been reported. Recent genetic data and theory in the general area of gene dosage effects has engendered a robust “gene balance hypothesis,” with a theoretical base that makes specific predictions as to gene content changes following different types of gene duplication. Genomic data from both chordate and angiosperm genomes fit these predictions: Each type of duplication provides a one-way injection of a biased set of genes into the gene pool. Tetraploidies and balanced segments inject bias for those genes whose products are the subunits of the most complex biological machines or cascades, like transcription factors (TFs) and proteasome core proteins. Most duplicate genes are removed after tetraploidy. Genic balance is maintained by not removing those genes that are dose-sensitive, which tends to leave duplicate “functional modules” as the indirect products (spandrels) of purifying selection. Functional modules are the likely precursors of coadapted gene complexes, a unit of natural selection. The result is a predictable drive mechanism where “drive” is used rigorously, as in “meiotic drive.” Rising morphological gain is expected given a supply of duplicate functional modules. All flowering plants have survived at least three large-scale duplications/diploidizations over the last 300 million years (Myr). An equivalent period of tetraploidy and body plan evolution may have ended for animals 500 million years ago (Mya). We argue that “balanced gene drive” is a sufficient explanation for the trend that the maximums of morphological complexity have gone up, and not down, in both plant and animal eukaryotic lineages.},

	abstract = {Despite the significance of haploinsufficiency in human disease, no systematic study has been reported into the types of genes that are haploinsufficient in human, or into the mechanisms that commonly lead to their deletion and to the expression of the haploinsufficient phenotype. We have applied a rigorous text-searching and database-mining strategy to extract, as comprehensively as possible, from PubMed and OMIM an annotated list of currently known human haploinsufficient genes, including their functions and associated diseases. Gene-set enrichment analysis shows that genes-encoding transcription factors, and genes that function in development, the cell cycle, and nucleic acid metabolism are overrepresented among haploinsufficient genes in human. Many of the phenotypes associated with loss-of-function or deletion of one copy of a haploinsufficient gene describe mental retardation, developmental or metabolic disorders, or tumourigenesis. We also found that haploinsufficient genes are less likely than the complete set of human genes to be situated between pairs of segmental duplications (SDs) that are in close proximity to each other on the same chromosome. Given that SDs can initiate non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and the deletion of adjacent genomic regions, this suggests that the location of haploinsufficient genes between SD pairs, from whence they may suffer intra-genomic rearrangement and loss, is selectively disadvantageous. We describe a custom-made Java visualization tool, HaploGeneMapper, to aid in visualizing the proximity of human haploinsufficient genes to SDs and to enable identification of haploinsufficient genes that are vulnerable to NAHR-mediated deletion.},

However, in contrast with the latter, their phylogenetic evolution has been poorly studied. Our objective was to study in 16 mammals the evolution of 16 genes that encode oviductal proteins involved in at least one of the following steps: (1) sperm-oviduct interaction, (2) acrosome reaction, and/or (3) sperm-zona pellucida interaction. Most genes were present in all studied mammals. However, some genes were lost along the evolution of mammals and found as pseudogenes: annexin A5 (ANXA5) and deleted in malignant brain tumor 1 (DMBT1) in tarsier; oviductin (OVGP1) in megabat; and probably progestagen-associated endometrial protein (PAEP) in tarsier, mouse, rat, rabbit, dolphin, and megabat; prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) in microbat; and plasminogen (PLG) in megabat. Four genes [ANXA1, ANXA4, ANXA5, and heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 (HSPA5)] showed branch-site positive selection, whereas for seven genes [ANXA2, lactotransferrin (LTF), OVGP1, PLG, S100 calcium-binding protein A11 (S100A11), Sperm adhesion molecule 1 (SPAM1), and osteopontin (SPP1)] branch-site model and model-site positive selection were observed. These results strongly suggest that genes encoding oviductal proteins that are known to be important for gamete fertilization are subjected to positive selection during evolution, as numerous genes encoding proteins from mammalian seminal fluid. This suggests that such a rapid evolution may have as a consequence that two isolated populations become separate species more rapidly.},

En ce sens, les études évolutives sont incontestablement nécessaires pour donner un sens aux données biologiques. Dans ce contexte, le laboratoire développe des outils pour étudier l'évolution des génomes (et protéomes) à travers les mutations subies. Cette thèse porte sur l'étude spécifique des événements de pertes de gènes unitaires. Ces événements peuvent révéler des pertes de fonctions très instructives pour comprendre l'évolution des espèces. En premier lieu, j'ai développé l'outil GLADX qui mime l'expertise humaine afin d'étudier automatiquement et avec précision les événements de pertes de gènes unitaires. Ces études se basent sur la création et l'interprétation de données phylogénétiques, de BLAST, de prédictions protéiques, etc., dans un contexte automatisé. Ensuite, j'ai développé une stratégie utilisant l'outil GLADX pour étudier à grande échelle les pertes de gènes unitaires au cours de l'évolution du protéome humain. La stratégie utilise d'abord comme filtre l'analyse de groupes d'orthologues fabriqués par un outil de clustérisation à partir du protéome complet de nombreuses espèces. Cette analyse a permis de détecter 6237 pertes de gènes unitaires putatives dans la lignée humaine. L'étude approfondie de ces pertes avec GLADX a mis en évidence de nombreux problèmes liés à la qualité des données disponibles dans les bases de données.},

	abstract = {Ma thèse applique le concept d’horloge moléculaire à l’échelle de l’arbre de gène. L’arbre de gène ne se décalque pas exactement sur celui des espèces, car le nombre de copies fonctionnelles dans un même génome varie, soit par duplication sur un nouveau locus, soit par perte (pseudogénéisation ou délétion). Ces événements fréquents de duplication et perte sont cruciaux pour l’adaptation des organismes, en leur fournissant une grande plasticité génétique. Pour cette raison, j’ai travaillé sur l’ensemble des arbres de gènes d’une vingtaine d’espèces de primates, avec pour objectif de dater les duplications. Par contraste avec la concaténation de plusieurs alignements, l’utilisation d’une seule famille génique impose une limite sur la puissance statistique. C’est ce que nous quantifions dans un premier temps, en effectuant un contrôle comparant les datations des spéciations dans les arbres de gènes avec les âges de référence des taxons. Avec ce contrôle, nous sélectionnons une procédure de datation précise, qui optimise la qualité de l’alignement en amont. Nous déterminons la distribution de la précision de datation et l’associons ensuite à diverses caractéristiques mesurables sur les arbres de gènes et les alignements. Notre analyse confirme l’impact de la longueur d’alignement dans la précision, mais aussi de l’hétérogénéité des taux de substitution entre branches, qui est compliquée à accomoder par les modèles d’horloge moléculaire. Concrètement, notre stratégie permet de prédire un niveau de précision sur de nouvelles données, et nous l’appliquons aux datations de duplications. À partir de cette prédiction de confiance sur les datations d’arbres avec duplications, nous sélectionnons le sous-jeu de meilleure qualité pour établir la distribution temporelle des duplications le long des lignées. Outre les dates, nous calculons les taux de duplications et caractérisons leur variation : ils sont en effet inégaux entre arbres de gènes, avec de nombreux arbres sans duplication et une faible proportion d’arbres se dupliquant beaucoup, ce qui peut se modéliser par une loi Gamma. De plus, le taux de duplication varie entre lignées d’organismes. Nous testons la corrélation phylogénétique entre taux de duplication génomique moyen par lignée et diversification de cette lignée. Enfin, des pertes de gènes impliqués dans la latéralisation de l’embryon caractérisent certains taxons de vertébrés. Nous établissons donc par corrélation de nouvelles séquences potentiellement fonctionnelles chez l’humain en criblant les gènes et enhancers montrant des pertes similaires. Ainsi, après avoir évalué les méthodes appropriées pour une inférence fiable, nous avons caractérisé les dynamiques de renouvellement des gènes. Cette étape ouvre la voie pour comprendre l’association entre ces dynamiques génomiques et les dynamiques macroévolutives et l’adaptation ou la diversification des organismes.},

	abstract = {The vertebrate spinal cord is organized across three developmental axes, anteriorposterior (AP), dorsal-ventral (DV), and medial-lateral (ML). Patterning of these axes is regulated by canonical intercellular signaling pathways: the AP axis by Wnt, fibroblast growth factor, and retinoic acid (RA), the DV axis by Hedgehog, Tgfβ, and Wnt, and the ML axis where proliferation is controlled by Notch. Developmental time plays an important role in which signal does what and when. Patterning across the three axes is not independent, but linked by interactions between signaling pathway components and their transcriptional targets. Combined this builds a sophisticated organ with many different types of cell in specific AP, DV, and ML positions. Two living lineages share phylum Chordata with vertebrates, amphioxus, and tunicates, while the jawless fish such as lampreys, survive as the most basally divergent vertebrate lineage. Genes and mechanisms shared between lampreys and other vertebrates tell us what predated vertebrates, while those also shared with other chordates tell us what evolved early in chordate evolution. Between these lie vertebrate innovations: genetic and developmental changes linked to evolution of new morphology. These include gene duplications, differences in how signals are received, and new regulatory connections between signaling pathways and their target genes.},

In contrast, only one or two stat genes have been reported in C. elegans and in D. melanogaster. The main types of STAT found from bony fish to mammals are present in Agnathan genomes, but a typical STAT1-6 repertoire is only observed in jawed vertebrates. Comparative syntenies showed that STAT6 was the closest to the ancestor of the family. An extensive survey of stat genes across fish including polyploid species showed that whole genome duplications did not lead to a uniform expansion of stat genes. While 2 to 5 stat1 are present in salmonids, whose genome duplicated about 35My ago, only one copy of stat2 and stat6 is retained. In contrast, common carp, with a recent whole genome duplication (5-10My), possesses a doubled stat repertoire indicating that the elimination of stat2 and stat6 additional copies is not immediate. Altogether our data shed light on the multiplicity of evolutionary pathways followed by key components of the canonical cytokine receptor signalling pathway, and point to differential selective constraints exerted on these factors.},

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) eventually alert vertebrates about the presence of pathogens and elicit the immune responses. To date, 17 different TLRs have been identified in more than a dozen different fish species. Numerous studies revealed that specific piscine TLRs share functional properties with their mammalian counterparts. Nevertheless, remarkable distinct features of teleostean Toll-like receptor cascades have been discovered. A soluble TLR5 factor in rainbow trout for example might amplify danger signaling of membrane-bound TLR5 in a positive feed loop. Piscine TLR3 detects viral and additionally bacterial molecular patterns in contrast to mammalian TLR3. Regarding TLR4, the functional spectrum of this teleostean receptor is also different from its mammalian orthologue. While signaling quite similar as the mammalian counterpart in some fish species, it may down-regulate TLR activation in others or was even lost during evolution. The orthologues of human TLR6 and TLR10 are also absent in teleosts. Some piscine TLRs are encoded by duplicated genes, for example salmonid TLR22. TLR22 is found in several fish species but only as a non-functional pseudogene in man. Additional distinct features of the TLR pathway in bony fish suggest its specific optimization for the aquatic environment. This review summarizes studies characterizing TLRs from several teleost species and discusses features of piscine TLR signaling on the background of the respective mammalian knowledge.},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplications (WGD) are important evolutionary events. Our understanding of underlying mechanisms, including the evolution of duplicated genes after WGD, however remains incomplete. Teleost fish experienced a common WGD (teleost-specific genome duplication, or TGD) followed by a dramatic adaptive radiation leading to more than half of all vertebrate species. The analysis of gene expression patterns following TGD at the genome level has been limited by the lack of suitable genomic resources. The recent concomitant release of the genome sequence of spotted gar (a representative of holosteans, the closest lineage of teleosts that lacks the TGD) and the tissue-specific gene expression repertoires of over 20 holostean and teleostean fish species, including spotted gar, zebrafish and medaka (the PhyloFish project), offered a unique opportunity to study the evolution of gene expression following TGD in teleosts. We show that most TGD duplicates gained their current status (loss of one duplicate gene or retention of both duplicates) relatively rapidly after TGD (i.e. prior to the divergence of medaka and zebrafish lineages). The loss of one duplicate is the most common fate after TGD with a probability of approximately 80\%. In addition, the fate of duplicate genes after TGD, including subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or retention of two ‘similar’ copies occurred not only before, but also after the radiation of species tested, in consistency with a role of the TGD in speciation and/or evolution of gene function. Finally, we report novel cases of TGD ohnolog subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization that further illustrate the importance of these processes.},

	abstract = {Multiple rounds of whole-genome duplications (WGDs) punctuated the evolution of rayfin fish, a species-rich group comprising about half of all vertebrates. Rayfin fish, along with lobefin vertebrates including humans, derive from early vertebrate ancestors that evolved through two rounds of polyploidization (the first and second rounds of vertebrate genome duplication, VGD1 and VGD2) at the dawn of the vertebrate lineage. Furthermore, teleost fish underwent an additional round of polyploidization in their stem lineage, the teleost genome duplication (TGD). Additional WGD events occurred independently in numerous species and higher level taxa of teleosts and other rayfin fish, for example in salmonids, carp, and sturgeon, so that some fish lineages experienced at least four rounds of WGD since the origin of vertebrates. This chapter provides an overview of these polyploidization events in the fish lineage and focuses on the impact these genome duplications (GD) had on genome evolution in selected fish taxa. We then review evidence for the TGD and discuss its consequences for the evolution of gene content, order, and functions in the teleost lineage. We argue that, although evidence remains sparse, the TGD may have had a profound influence on the evolutionary success and the biodiversity of teleosts. Importantly, an in-depth understanding of the causes and consequences of the TGD and other teleost GD events will help to inform us about the evolution of our own paleopolyploid genome.},

After gene duplication, it is common for both daughter genes to accumulate sequence change at approximately equal rates. In some cases, however, the accumulation of sequence change is highly uneven with one copy radically diverging from its paralogue. Such 'asymmetric evolution' seems commoner after tandem gene duplication than after whole-genome duplication, and can generate substantially novel genes. We describe examples of asymmetric evolution in duplicated homeobox genes of moths, molluscs and mammals, in each case generating new homeobox genes that were recruited to novel developmental roles. The prevalence of asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates has been underappreciated, in part, because the origin of highly divergent genes can be difficult to resolve using standard phylogenetic methods.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding genome evolution provides insight into biological mechanisms. For many years comparative genomics and analysis of conserved chromosomal regions have helped to unravel the mechanisms involved in genome evolution and their implications for the study of biological systems. Detection of conserved regions (descending from a common ancestor) not only helps clarify genome evolution but also makes it possible to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and investigate gene function.The identification and comparison of conserved regions on a genome scale is computationally intensive, making process automation essential. Three key requirements are necessary: consideration of phylogeny to identify orthologs between multiple species, frequent updating of the annotation and panel of compared genomes and computation of statistical tests to assess the significance of identified conserved gene clusters.
RESULTS: We developed a modular system superimposed on a multi-agent framework, called CASSIOPE (Clever Agent System for Synteny Inheritance and Other Phenomena in Evolution). CASSIOPE automatically identifies statistically significant conserved regions between multiple genomes based on automated phylogenies and statistical testing. Conserved regions were searched for in 19 species and 1,561 hits were found. To our knowledge, CASSIOPE is the first system to date that integrates evolutionary biology-based concepts and fulfills all three key requirements stated above. All results are available at http://194.57.197.245/cassiopeWeb/displayCluster?clusterId=1
CONCLUSION: CASSIOPE makes it possible to study conserved regions from a chosen query genetic region and to infer conserved gene clusters based on phylogenies and statistical tests assessing the significance of these conserved regions.Source code is freely available, please contact: Pierre.pontarotti@univ-provence.fr.},

	abstract = {Every biological system is the outcome of evolution and has a history all its own. This history dictates how the system works and why it has certain properties and not others. This is why we need to study not only the structure and function, but also the history of the system. This argument undoubtedly applies to the study of the immune system and also to the study of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Since 1989, researchers of various scientific disciplines who share a deep inter est in MHC evolution have held a meeting every two years to discuss their latest research developments, exchange ideas, and foster friendship. Together with my colleagues Drs. Naoyuki Takahata and Yoko Satta, I organized the Sixth Interna tional Workshop on MHC Evolution in Hayama, Japan, May 25-29, 1999. This volume is the proceedings of that conference. It covers diverse topics pertinent to MHC evolution, including the origin of the adaptive immune system, the organi zation of the MHC in humans and other model vertebrates, MHC-parasite co evolution, and the nature and origin of MHC polymorphism. I hope that this book will be of interest not only for MHC researchers and immunologists, but also for other specialists who are interested in the evolution of biological systems in gen eral.},

We obtained a genome assembly of 1.7 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 1.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 24.7 kb. A total of 39,977 protein-coding genes were annotated. Based on a comparative phylogenetic analysis of five Sinocyclocheilus species and other five representative vertebrates with published genome sequences, we found that S. maitianheensis is close to Sinocyclocheilus anophthalmus (a cave-restricted species with similar locality). Moreover, the assembled genomes of S. maitianheensis and other four Sinocyclocheilus counterparts were used for a fourfold degenerative third-codon transversion (4dTv) analysis. The recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event was therefore estimated to occur about 18.1 million years ago. Our results also revealed a decreased tendency of copy number in many important genes related to immunity and apoptosis in cave-restricted Sinocyclocheilus species. In summary, we report the first genome assembly of S. maitianheensis, which provides a valuable genetic resource for comparative studies on cavefish biology, species protection, and practical aquaculture of this potentially economical fish.},

These include biologically interesting phenotypes that have not been observed in mutants of zebrafish or medaka. In addition, goldfish strains have been maintained in a non-wild environment for several hundreds of generations, and certain goldfish strains have phenotypes similar to some human diseases. The recent progress in the assembly of the whole-genome sequence of goldfish provides strong tools for a genetic analysis of these phenotypes. The whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred in the goldfish genome 8-14 million years ago; this is one of the latest WGD in vertebrates.

Trois duplications de génome complet (ou polyploidisations) sont survenues au cours de l'évolution des vertébrés, dont deux à la base des vertébrés et une troisième chez l'ancêtre commun des poissons téléostéens. La diversité morphologique, anatomique et écologique des espèces qui partagent un ancêtre commun polyploide chez les chordés suggère un rôle des duplications de génome dans la diversification des espèces. En particulier les duplications de génome semblent avoir facilité l'émergence du plan d'organisation des vertébrés et être à l'origine de la radiation évolutive survenue chez les poissons téléostéens. Cependant, la portée évolutive des duplications de génome, et notamment les deux hypothèses majeures formulées ci-avant, restent des questions ouvertes et en grande partie non résolues. Le groupe des téléostéens, qui compte plus de la moitié des espèces vertébrés existantes et partage un ancêtre commun polyploide, constitue un modèle pertinent pour évaluer la contribution des duplications de génome dans l'expansion des familles multigéniques chez les vertébrés, pour comprendre les mécanismes évolutifs et façonnent l'évolution des familles de gènes, et finalement tester des hypothèses moléculaires qui peuvent relier duplication de génome survenue à la base des téléostéens sur l'évolution de la famille multigénique sox, essentielle pour le développement et l'homéostasie des vertébrés.},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplication (leading to polyploidy) is widely accepted as an important evolutionary force in plants, but it is less recognized as a driver of animal diversification. Nevertheless, it occurs across a wide range of animals; this review investigates why it is particularly common in fish and amphibians, while rare among other vertebrates. We review the current geographic, ecological and phylogenetic distributions of sexually reproducing polyploid taxa before focusing more specifically on what factors drive polyploid formation and establishment. In summary, (1) polyploidy is phylogenetically restricted in both amphibians and fishes, although entire fish, but not amphibian, lineages are derived from polyploid ancestors. (2) Although mechanisms such as polyspermy are feasible, polyploid formation appears to occur principally through unreduced gamete formation, which can be experimentally induced by temperature or pressure shock in both groups. (3) External reproduction and fertilization in primarily temperate freshwater environments potentially exposes zygotes to temperature stress, which can promote increased production of unreduced gametes. (4) Large numbers of gametes and group breeding in relatively confined areas could increase the probability of compatible gamete combinations in both groups. (5) Both fish and amphibians have a propensity to form reproductively successful hybrids; although the relative frequency of autopolyploidy versus allopolyploidy is difficult to ascertain, multiple origins involving hybridization have been confirmed for a number of species in both groups. (6) Problems with establishment of polyploid lineages associated with minority cytotype exclusion could be overcome in amphibians via assortative mating by acoustic recognition of the same ploidy level, but less attention has been given to chemical or acoustic mechanisms that might operate in fish. (7) There is no strong evidence that polyploid fish or amphibians currently exist in more extreme environments than their diploid progenitors or have broader ecological ranges. (8) Although pathogens could play a role in the relative fitness of polyploid species, particularly given duplication of genes involved in immunity, this remains an understudied field in both fish and amphibians. (9) As in plants, many duplicate copies of genes are retained for long periods of time, indicative of selective maintenance of the duplicate copies, but we find no physiological or other reasons that could explain an advantage for allelic or genetic complexity. (10) Extant polyploid species do not appear to be more or less prone to extinction than related diploids in either group. We conclude that, while polyploid fish and amphibians share a number of attributes facilitating polyploidy, clear drivers of genome duplication do not emerge from the comparison. The lack of a clear association of sexually reproducing polyploids with range expansion, harsh environments, or risk of extinction could suggest that stronger correlations in plants may be driven by shifts in mating system more than ploidy. However, insufficient data currently exist to provide rigorous tests of these hypotheses and we make a plea for zoologists to also consider polyploidy as a possibility in continuing taxonomic surveys.},

These are crucial for all levels of cellular function, including architecture, metabolism and signalling, as well as the availability of cellular energy. Very stable, but also rather transient and dynamic protein-protein interactions generate new system properties at the level of multiprotein complexes, cellular compartments or the entire cell. Thus, interactomics is expected to largely contribute to emerging fields like systems biology or systems bioenergetics. The more recent technological development of high-throughput methods for interactomics research will dramatically increase our knowledge of protein interaction networks. The two most frequently used methods are yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening, a well established genetic in vivo approach, and affinity purification of complexes followed by mass spectrometry analysis, an emerging biochemical in vitro technique. So far, a majority of published interactions have been detected using an Y2H screen. However, with the massive application of this method, also some limitations have become apparent. This review provides an overview on available yeast two-hybrid methods, in particular focusing on more recent approaches. These allow detection of protein interactions in their native environment, as e.g. in the cytosol or bound to a membrane, by using cytosolic signalling cascades or split protein constructs. Strengths and weaknesses of these genetic methods are discussed and some guidelines for verification of detected protein-protein interactions are provided.},

quired to carry out the organs’ functions. In this way, an ex-
tracellular stimulus is transmitted to an intracellular target
through an array of interacting protein intermediaries, ulti-
mately enabling the target cell to elicit a response. Surpris-
ingly, only a small number of signaling pathways are impli-
cated throughout embryogenesis and are used over and
over again. Gonadogenesis is a unique process in that 2
morphologically distinct organs, the testes and ovaries, arise
from a common precursor, the bipotential genital ridge.
Accordingly, most of the signaling pathways observed
throughout embryogenesis also have been shown to be im-
portant for mammalian sex determination and gonad devel-
opment. Here, we review the mechanisms of signal trans-
duction within these pathways and the importance of these
pathways throughout mammalian gonad development,
mainly concentrating on data obtained in mouse but includ-
ing other species where appropriate.},

Until now, the use of the SignaLink database for zebrafish pathway analysis was limited. To overcome this limitation, we created SignaFish ( http://signafish.org ), a fish-specific signaling resource, built using the concept of SignaLink. SignaFish contains more than 200 curation-based signaling interactions, 132 further interactions listed in other resources, and it also lists potential miRNA-based regulatory connections for seven major signaling pathways. From the SignaFish website, users can reach other web resources, such as ZFIN. SignaFish provides signaling or signaling-related interactions that can be examined for each gene or downloaded for each signaling pathway. We believe that the SignaFish resource will serve as a novel navigating point for experimental design and evaluation for the zebrafish community and for researchers focusing on nonmodel fish species, such as cyclids.},

	abstract = {The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39\% vs. 25\% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32\% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.},

Due to their particular importance, the identification of duplicated genes is essential when studying genome evolution but it can still be a challenge due to the various fates duplicated genes can encounter. In this review, we first describe the evolutionary processes allowing the formation of duplicated genes but also describe the various bioinformatic approaches that can be used to identify them in genome sequences. Indeed, these bioinformatic approaches differ according to the underlying duplication mechanism. Hence, understanding the specificity of the duplicated genes of interest is a great asset for tool selection and should be taken into account when exploring a biological question.},

Recently, algorithms based on inverse statistical physics, e.g. Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), have allowed to use evolutionarily related sequences to address two conceptually related inference tasks: finding pairs of interacting proteins, and identifying pairs of residues which form contacts between interacting proteins. Here we address two underlying questions: How are the performances of both inference tasks related? How does performance depend on dataset size and the quality? To this end, we formalize both tasks using Ising models defined over stochastic block models, with individual blocks representing single proteins, and inter-block couplings protein-protein interactions; controlled synthetic sequence data are generated by Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that DCA is able to address both inference tasks accurately when sufficiently large training sets are available, and that an iterative pairing algorithm (IPA) allows to make predictions even without a training set. Noise in the training data deteriorates performance. In both tasks we find a quadratic scaling relating dataset quality and size that is consistent with noise adding in square-root fashion and signal adding linearly when increasing the dataset. This implies that it is generally good to incorporate more data even if its quality is imperfect, thereby shedding light on the empirically observed performance of DCA applied to natural protein sequences.},

However, the origin of PCD genes in prokaryotes themselves (bacteria and archaea) is poorly understood and a source of controversy. Whether archaea also contain C14 peptidase enzymes and other death domains is largely unknown because of a historical dearth of genomic data. Archaeal genomic databases have grown significantly in the last decade, which allowed us to perform a detailed comparative study of the evolutionary histories of PCD-related death domains in major archaeal phyla, including the deepest branching phyla of Candidatus Aenigmarchaeota, Candidatus Woesearchaeota, and Euryarchaeota. We identified death domains associated with executioners of PCD, like the caspase homologs of the C14 peptidase family, in 321 archaea sequences. Of these, 15.58\% were metacaspase type I orthologues and 84.42\% were orthocaspases. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed a scattered distribution of orthocaspases and metacaspases in deep-branching bacteria and archaea. The tree topology was incongruent with the prokaryote 16S phylogeny suggesting a common ancestry of PCD genes in prokaryotes and subsequent massive horizontal gene transfer coinciding with the divergence of archaea and bacteria. Previous arguments for the origin of PCD were philosophical in nature with two popular propositions being the “addiction” and ‘original sin’ hypotheses. Our data support the ‘original sin’ hypothesis, which argues for a pleiotropic origin of the PCD toolkit with pro-life and pro-death functions tracing back to the emergence of cellular life—the Last Universal Common Ancestor State.},

With the ever increasing advance in genome sequencing and analysis tools, our understanding of the animal world and its evolution has greatly increased in the recent years. We used bioinformatic tools to study the evolution of the Hippo/YAP pathway focusing on the transcriptional coactivator YAP, which is a pivotal effector of the pathway. The aim was to establish the origin and mode of development of YAP and its pathway in the animal world. Some pathway members can be already identiﬁed in single-celled eukaryotes like the yeast that have preceded multicellular animals. Interestingly, we can ﬁnd most of the components that are present in human in the sea-anemone Nematostella, which belongs to a very basal group of metazoans, the cnidarians. All the major domains of YAP have been conserved between cnidarians and mammals, and YAP can be identiﬁed even in the more basal placozoan clade. We show a very high degree of conservation in regions such as the WW and the TEAD-binding domains, TEAD being the major DNA-binding partner of YAP. Remarkably, we found that the location of an intron in the WW1 genomic region has been invariant along an evolutionary span of over 700 My. We have followed the evolutionary changes in YAP and in other main components of the pathway from the ﬁrst metazoans such as sponges, described the phylogenetic relationships between the YAP genes and indicated where YAP and other components have been secondarily lost. Evidence is provided that YAP and its binding partner TEAD demonstrate strong coevolution. This gives further support for the importance of the TEAD–YAP association. Beyond contributing to an understanding of the evolutionary history of this pathway, we have provided insights into the ‘‘birth’’ of this pathway, its functions and its mode of operation in animals with different body plans, development, and life styles.},

The extrapolation of the concepts and methodologies developed for the study of species co-evolution at the molecular level has prompted the development of a variety of computational methods able to predict protein interactions through the characteristics of co-evolution. Particularly successful have been those methods that predict interactions at the genomic level based on the detection of pairs of protein families with similar evolutionary histories (similarity of phylogenetic trees: mirrortree). Future advances in this field will require a better understanding of the molecular basis of the co-evolution of protein families. Thus, it will be important to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the similarity observed in phylogenetic trees of interacting proteins, distinguishing direct specific molecular interactions from other general functional constraints. In particular, it will be important to separate the effects of physical interactions within protein complexes ('co-adaptation') from other forces that, in a less specific way, can also create general patterns of co-evolution.},

Reduction after whole genome duplication (WGD) represents an inexorable collapse in gene complement.
RESULTS: We compare fifteen genomes descending from six eukaryotic WGD events 20-450 Mya. We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. Descendant genomes of the same WGD event behave as replicates. Choice of paralog pairs to be reduced is random except for some resistant regions of contiguous pairs. For those paralog pairs that are reduced, conserved copies tend to concentrate on one chromosome.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the contiguous regions of reduction-resistant pairs and the concentration of runs of single copy genes on a single chromosome are evidence of transcriptional co-regulation, dosage sensitivity or other functional interaction constraining the reduction process. These constraints and their evolution over time show a consistent pattern across evolutionary domains and a highly reproducible pattern, as replicates, for the several descendants of a single WGD.},

Studies on the effect of network architecture on the evolution of individual proteins will provide valuable information for understanding the origin and evolution as well as functional conservation of signaling pathways. However, the relationship between the network architecture and the individual protein sequence evolution is yet little known. In current study, we carried out network-level molecular evolution analysis on TLR (Toll-like receptor ) signaling pathway, which plays an important role in innate immunity in insects and mammals, and we found that: 1) The selection constraint of genes was negatively correlated with its position along TLR signaling pathway; 2) all genes in TLR signaling pathway were highly conserved and underwent strong purifying selection; 3) the distribution of selective pressure along the pathway was driven by differential nonsynonymous substitution levels; 4) The TLR signaling pathway might present in a common ancestor of sponges and eumetazoa, and evolve via the TLR, IKK, IκB and NF-κB genes underwent duplication events as well as adaptor molecular enlargement, and gene structure and conservation motif of NF-κB genes shifted in their evolutionary history. Our results will improve our understanding on the evolutionary history of animal TLR signaling pathway as well as the relationship between the network architecture and the sequences evolution of individual protein.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections. It produces numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever, and has acquired resistance to practically all antibiotics. Whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards future development of countermeasures against this organism.
METHODS: Whole genome sequences of two related S aureus strains (N315 and Mu50) were determined by shot-gun random sequencing. N315 is a meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) strain isolated in 1982, and Mu50 is an MRSA strain with vancomycin resistance isolated in 1997. The open reading frames were identified by use of GAMBLER and GLIMMER programs, and annotation of each was done with a BLAST homology search, motif analysis, and protein localisation prediction.
FINDINGS: The Staphylococcus genome was composed of a complex mixture of genes, many of which seem to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer. Most of the antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island. Three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the genome: a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family, exotoxin islands, and enterotoxin islands. In the latter two pathogenicity islands, clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative pathogenic factors. The analysis also identified 70 candidates for new virulence factors.
INTERPRETATION: The remarkable ability of S aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was revealed through the observation of genome complexity and evidence of lateral gene transfer. Repeated duplication of genes encoding superantigens explains why S aureus is capable of infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds, eliciting severe immune reactions. Investigation of many newly identified gene products, including the 70 putative virulence factors, will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci and the processes of infectious diseases caused by S aureus.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) events have shaped the history of many evolutionary lineages. One such duplication has been implicated in the evolution of teleost fishes, by far the most species-rich vertebrate clade. After initial controversy, there is now solid evidence that such event took place in the common ancestor of all extant teleosts. It is termed teleost-specific (TS) WGD. After WGD, duplicate genes have different fates. The most likely outcome is non-functionalization of one duplicate gene due to the lack of selective constraint on preserving both. Mechanisms that act on preservation of duplicates are subfunctionalization (partitioning of ancestral gene functions on the duplicates), neofunctionalization (assigning a novel function to one of the duplicates) and dosage selection (preserving genes to maintain dosage balance between interconnected components). Since the frequency of these mechanisms is influenced by the genes' properties, there are over-retained classes of genes, such as highly expressed ones and genes involved in neural function. The consequences of the TS-WGD, especially its impact on the massive radiation of teleosts, have been matter of controversial debate. It is evident that gene duplications are crucial for generating complexity and that WGDs provide large amounts of raw material for evolutionary adaptation and innovation. However, it is less clear whether the TS-WGD is directly linked to the evolutionary success of teleosts and their radiation. Recent studies let us conclude that TS-WGD has been important in generating teleost complexity, but that more recent ecological adaptations only marginally related to TS-WGD might have even contributed more to diversification. It is likely, however, that TS-WGD provided teleosts with diversification potential that can become effective much later, such as during phases of environmental change.},

	abstract = {Lungfishes belong to lobe-fined fish (Sarcopterygii) that, in the Devonian period, 'conquered' the land and ultimately gave rise to all land vertebrates, including humans1-3. Here we determine the chromosome-quality genome of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), which is known to have the largest genome of any animal. The vast size of this genome, which is about 14× larger than that of humans, is attributable mostly to huge intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (around 90\%), the components of which resemble those of tetrapods (comprising mainly long interspersed nuclear elements) more than they do those of ray-finned fish. The lungfish genome continues to expand independently (its transposable elements are still active), through mechanisms different to those of the enormous genomes of salamanders. The 17 fully assembled lungfish macrochromosomes maintain synteny to other vertebrate chromosomes, and all microchromosomes maintain conserved ancient homology with the ancestral vertebrate karyotype. Our phylogenomic analyses confirm previous reports that lungfish occupy a key evolutionary position as the closest living relatives to tetrapods4,5, underscoring the importance of lungfish for understanding innovations associated with terrestrialization. Lungfish preadaptations to living on land include the gain of limb-like expression in developmental genes such as hoxc13 and sall1 in their lobed fins. Increased rates of evolution and the duplication of genes associated with obligate air-breathing, such as lung surfactants and the expansion of odorant receptor gene families (which encode proteins involved in detecting airborne odours), contribute to the tetrapod-like biology of lungfishes. These findings advance our understanding of this major transition during vertebrate evolution.},

We demonstrate that a majority of genes show evidence of compositional heterogeneity, and that support for the Cnidaria + Bilateria clade can be assigned to this source of systematic error. In interpreting these results, we caution against a peremptory reading of placozoans as secondarily reduced forms of little relevance to broader discussions of early animal evolution.},

We argue here that competing molecular clock hypotheses should be testable in the fossil record, on the principle that fundamentally new grades of animal organization will have ecosystem-wide impacts. Using a set of seven nuclear-encoded protein sequences, we demonstrate the paraphyly of Porifera and calculate sponge/eumetazoan and cnidarian/bilaterian divergence times by using both distance [minimum evolution (ME)] and maximum likelihood (ML) molecular clocks; ME brackets the appearance of Eumetazoa between 634 and 604 Ma, whereas ML suggests it was between 867 and 748 Ma. Significantly, the ME, but not the ML, estimate is coincident with a major regime change in the Proterozoic acritarch record, including: (i) disappearance of low-diversity, evolutionarily static, pre-Ediacaran acanthomorphs; (ii) radiation of the high-diversity, short-lived Doushantuo-Pertatataka microbiota; and (iii) an order-of-magnitude increase in evolutionary turnover rate. We interpret this turnover as a consequence of the novel ecological challenges accompanying the evolution of the eumetazoan nervous system and gut. Thus, the more readily preserved microfossil record provides positive evidence for the absence of pre-Ediacaran eumetazoans and strongly supports the veracity, and therefore more general application, of the ME molecular clock.},

A younger origin of Metazoa would require greatly increased substitution rates across many clades and many genes; while not impossible, this is less parsimonious. Yet the first fossil evidence for metazoans (the Doushantuo embryos) about 600 Ma is followed by the Ediacaran fossils after 580 Ma, the earliest undisputed bilaterians at 555 Ma, and an increase in the size and morphologic complexity of bilaterians around 542 Ma. This temporal framework suggests a missing 150-200 Myr of early metazoan history that encompasses many apparent novelties in the early evolution of the nervous system. This span includes two major glaciations, and complex marine geochemical changes including major changes in redox and other environmental changes. One possible resolution is that animals of these still unknown Cryogenian and early Ediacaran ecosystems were relatively simple, with highly conserved developmental genes involved in cell-type specification and simple patterning. In this model, complex nervous systems are a convergent phenomenon in bilaterian clades which occurred close to the time that larger metazoans appeared in the fossil record.},

	abstract = {Changes in cis-regulatory element composition that result in novel patterns of gene expression are thought to be a major contributor to the evolution of lineage-specific traits. Although transcription factor binding events show substantial variation across species, most computational approaches to study regulatory elements focus primarily upon highly conserved sites, and rely heavily upon multiple sequence alignments. However, sequence conservation based approaches have limited ability to detect lineage-specific elements that could contribute to species-specific traits. In this paper, we describe a novel framework that utilizes a birth-death model to trace the evolution of lineage-specific binding sites without relying on detailed base-by-base cross-species alignments. Our model was applied to analyze the evolution of binding sites based on the ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, ETS1) along the lineage toward human after human-mouse common ancestor. We estimate that a substantial fraction of binding sites (,58–79\% for each factor) in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse. Over 15\% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. Such elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways, and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. These results support the ability of our method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and help understand their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species.},

In Drosophila and mammals, studies over the past decade have uncovered a critical role for the Hippo tumour-suppressor pathway in the regulation of organ size. Dysregulation of this pathway leads to massive overgrowth of tissue. The Hippo signalling pathway is highly conserved and limits organ size by phosphorylating and inhibiting the transcription co-activators YAP and TAZ in mammals and Yki in Drosophila, key regulators of proliferation and apoptosis. The Hippo pathway also has a critical role in the self-renewal and expansion of stem cells and tissue-specific progenitor cells, and has important functions in tissue regeneration. Emerging evidence shows that the Hippo pathway is regulated by cell polarity, cell adhesion and cell junction proteins.

YAP and TAZ activity is key for the growth of whole organs, for amplification of tissue-specific progenitor cells during tissue renewal and regeneration, and for cell proliferation. In tumors, YAP/TAZ can reprogram cancer cells into cancer stem cells and incite tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. As such, YAP/TAZ are appealing therapeutic targets in cancer and regenerative medicine. Just like the function of YAP/TAZ offers a molecular entry point into the mysteries of tissue biology, their regulation by upstream cues is equally captivating. YAP/TAZ are well known for being the effectors of the Hippo signaling cascade, and mouse mutants in Hippo pathway components display remarkable phenotypes of organ overgrowth, enhanced stem cell content and reduced cellular differentiation. YAP/TAZ are primary sensors of the cell's physical nature, as defined by cell structure, shape and polarity. YAP/TAZ activation also reflects the cell “social” behavior, including cell adhesion and the mechanical signals that the cell receives from tissue architecture and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). At the same time, YAP/TAZ entertain relationships with morphogenetic signals, such as Wnt growth factors, and are also regulated by Rho, GPCRs and mevalonate metabolism. YAP/TAZ thus appear at the centerpiece of a signaling nexus by which cells take control of their behavior according to their own shape, spatial location and growth factor context.},

Here we review recent studies on insulin action and the mechanistic association with mitochondrial metabolism. These studies suggest that insulin signaling underpins mitochondrial electron transport chain integrity and activity by suppressing FOXO1/HMOX1 and maintaining the NAD+/NADH ratio, the mediator of the SIRT1/PGC1α pathway for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Mitochondria generate moderately reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhance insulin sensitivity upon redox regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase and insulin receptor.

We now know that prolactin is not as simple as originally described. Indeed, chemically, prolactin appears in a multiplicity of posttranslational forms ranging from size variants to chemical modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation. It is not only synthesized in the pituitary gland, as originally described, but also within the central nervous system, the immune system, the uterus and its associated tissues of conception, and even the mammary gland itself. Moreover, its biological actions are not limited solely to reproduction because it has been shown to control a variety of behaviors and even play a role in homeostasis. Prolactin-releasing stimuli not only include the nursing stimulus, but light, audition, olfaction, and stress can serve a stimulatory role. Finally, although it is well known that dopamine of hypothalamic origin provides inhibitory control over the secretion of prolactin, other factors within the brain, pituitary gland, and peripheral organs have been shown to inhibit or stimulate prolactin secretion as well. It is the purpose of this review to provide a comprehensive survey of our current understanding of prolactin's function and its regulation and to expose some of the controversies still existing.},

	abstract = {Insulin signalling begins with binding to its cell surface insulin receptor (IR), which is a tyrosine kinase. The insulin receptor kinase (IRK) is subsequently autophosphorylated and activated to tyrosine phosphorylate key cellular substrates that are essential for entraining the insulin response. Although IRK activation begins at the cell surface, it is maintained and augmented following internalization into the endosomal system (ENS). The peroxovanadium compounds (pVs) were discovered to activate the IRK in the absence of insulin and lead to a full insulin response. Thus, IRK activation is both necessary and sufficient for insulin signalling. Furthermore, this could be shown to occur with activation of only the endosomal IRK. The mechanism of pV action was shown to be the inhibition of IRK-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Our studies showed that the duration and intensity of insulin signalling are modulated within ENS by the recruitment of cellular substrates to ENS; intra-endosomal acidification, which promotes dissociation of insulin from the IRK; an endosomal acidic insulinase, which degrades intra-endosomal insulin; and IRK-associated PTPs, which dephosphorylate and, hence, deactivate the IRK. Therefore, the internalization of IRKs is central to insulin signalling and its regulation.},

Recent studies have expanded the Hippo pathway as a complex signaling network with {\textgreater}30 components. This pathway is regulated by intrinsic cell machineries, such as cell–cell contact, cell polarity, and actin cytoskeleton, as well as a wide range of signals, including cellular energy status, mechanical cues, and hormonal signals that actthrough G-protein-coupled receptors.

In this study, we aimed to document the conservation of genes involved in spermatogenesis from flies to vertebrates and their expression profiles in vertebrates.
RESULTS: We retrieved 379 Drosophila melanogaster genes that are functionally involved in male reproduction according to their mutant phenotypes and listed their vertebrate orthologs. 83\% of the fly genes have at least one vertebrate ortholog for a total of 625 mouse orthologs. This conservation percentage is almost twice as high as the 42\% rate for the whole fly genome and is similar to that previously found for genes preferentially expressed in ovaries. Of the 625 mouse orthologs, we selected 68 mouse genes of interest, 42 of which exhibited a predominant relative expression in testes and 26 were their paralogs. These 68 mouse genes exhibited 144 and 60 orthologs in chicken and zebrafish, respectively, gathered in 28 groups of paralogs. Almost two thirds of the chicken orthologs and half of the zebrafish orthologs exhibited a relative expression ≥50\% in testis. Finally, our focus on functional in silico data demonstrated that most of these genes were involved in the germ cell process, primarily in structure elaboration/maintenance and in acid nucleic metabolism.
CONCLUSION: Our work confirms that the genes involved in germ cell development are highly conserved across evolution in vertebrates and invertebrates and display a high rate of conservation of preferential testicular expression among vertebrates. Among the genes highlighted in this study, three mouse genes (Lrrc46, Pabpc6 and Pkd2l1) have not previously been described in the testes, neither their zebrafish nor chicken orthologs. The phylogenetic approach developed in this study finally allows considering new testicular genes for further fundamental studies in vertebrates, including model species (mouse and zebrafish).},

Recently, we reported that a specific histone modification signature is strongly associated with MAE and demonstrated that it can serve as a proxy of MAE in human lymphoblastoid cells. Here, we use murine cells to establish that this chromatin signature is conserved between mouse and human and is associated with MAE in multiple cell types. Our analyses reveal extensive conservation in the identity of MAE genes between the two species. By analyzing MAE chromatin signature in a large number of cell and tissue types, we show that it remains consistent during terminal cell differentiation and is predominant among cell-type specific genes, suggesting a link between MAE and specification of cell identity.},

Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes.

	abstract = {Insulin is the major hormone controlling critical energy functions such as glucose and lipid metabolism. Insulin activates the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IR), which phosphorylates and recruits different substrate adaptors such as the IRS family of proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylated IRS then displays binding sites for numerous signaling partners. Among them, PI3K has a major role in insulin function, mainly via the activation of the Akt/PKB and the PKCζ cascades. Activated Akt induces glycogen synthesis through inhibition of GSK-3; protein synthesis via mTOR and downstream elements; and cell survival through inhibition of several pro-apoptotic agents (Bad, FoxO transcription factors, GSK-3, and MST1). Akt phosphorylates and directly inhibits FoxO transcription factors, which also regulate metabolism and autophagy. Inversely, AMPK is known to directly regulate FoxO3 and activate transcriptional activity. Insulin signaling also has growth and mitogenic effects, which are mostly mediated by the Akt cascade as well as by activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. The insulin signaling pathway inhibits autophagy via the ULK1 kinase, which is inhibited by Akt and mTORC1, and activated by AMPK. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in muscle and adipocytes via translocation of GLUT4 vesicles to the plasma membrane. GLUT4 translocation involves the PI3K/Akt pathway and IR-mediated phosphorylation of CAP, and formation of the CAP:CBL:CRKII complex. In addition, insulin signaling inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver, through disruption of CREB/CBP/mTORC2 binding. Insulin signaling induces fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis via the regulation of SREBP transcription factors. Insulin signaling also promotes fatty acid synthesis through activation of USF1 and LXR. A negative feedback signal emanating from Akt/PKB, PKCζ, p70 S6K, and the MAPK cascades results in serine phosphorylation and inactivation of IRS signaling.},

However, little is known regarding functional evolution of the PDZ3:CRIPT interaction. Here, we subjected PDZ3 and CRIPT to ancestral sequence reconstruction, resurrection, and biophysical experiments. We show that the PDZ3:CRIPT interaction is an ancient interaction, which was likely present in the last common ancestor of Eukaryotes, and that high afﬁnity is maintained in most extant animal phyla. However, afﬁnity is low in nematodes and insects, raising questions about the physiological function of the interaction in species from these animal groups. Our ﬁndings demonstrate how an apparently established protein–protein interaction involved in cellular scaffolding in bilaterians can suddenly be subject to dynamic evolution including possible loss of function.},

	abstract = {With about 24,000 extant species, teleosts are the largest group of vertebrates. They constitute more than 99\% of the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) that diverged from the lobe-finned fish lineage (Sarcopterygii) about 450 MYA. Although the role of genome duplication in the evolution of vertebrates is now established, its role in structuring the teleost genomes has been controversial. At least two hypotheses have been proposed: a whole-genome duplication in an ancient ray-finned fish and independent gene duplications in different lineages. These hypotheses are, however, based on small data sets and lack adequate statistical and phylogenetic support. In this study, we have made a systematic comparison of the draft genome sequences of Fugu and humans to identify paralogous chromosomal regions (“paralogons”) in the Fugu that arose in the ray-finned fish lineage (“fish-specific”). We identified duplicate genes in the Fugu by phylogenetic analyses of the Fugu, human, and invertebrate sequences. Our analyses provide evidence for 425 fish-specific duplicate genes in the Fugu and show that at least 6.6\% of the genome is represented by fish-specific paralogons. We estimated the ages of Fugu duplicate genes and paralogons using the molecular clock. Remarkably, the ages of duplicate genes and paralogons are clustered, with a peak around 350 MYA. These data strongly suggest a whole-genome duplication event early during the evolution of ray-finned fishes, probably before the origin of teleosts.},

Specifically, I examine the nature of HI for transcription factor genes. Although the concept of HI applies to many such genes, there is a potentially large variety of mechanisms that underlie it. Even when the phenomenon is linked in all cases to reduced absolute gene expression levels, there are several well-documented cases where the explanation is not reduced expression per se but altered stoichiometry. I will discuss the notion of haploimbalance in general and evaluate the property of transcriptional synergy within the context of HI. This kind of non-linear behaviour can probably explain a large proportion of the cases of HI, as well as the variability in most HI phenotypes and the fact that several factors in the same pathway may be dosage sensitive. For the sake of generality, a theoretical analysis of simple non-linear HI systems is also attempted. This article is certainly another preliminary exploration of the complex matters of HI, which remain an intellectual challenge from many points of view.},

	abstract = {FSH is synthesized in the pituitary by gonadotrope cells. By binding to and interacting with its cognate receptor [FSH receptor (FSHR)] in the gonads, this gonadotropin plays a key role in the control of gonadal function and reproduction. Upon activation, the FSHR undergoes conformational changes leading to transduction of intracellular signals, including dissociation of G protein complexes into components and activation of several associated interacting partners, which concertedly regulate downstream effectors. The canonical Gs/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway, considered for a long time as the sole effector of FSHR-mediated signaling, is now viewed as one of several mechanisms employed by this receptor to transduce intracellular signals in response to the FSH stimulus. This complex network of signaling pathways allows for a fine-tuning regulation of the gonadotropic stimulus, where activation/inhibition of its multiple components vary depending on the cell context, cell developmental stage, and concentration of associated receptors and corresponding ligands. Activation of these multiple signaling modules eventually converge to the hormone-integrated biological response, including survival, proliferation and differentiation of target cells, synthesis and secretion of paracrine/autocrine regulators, and, at the molecular level, functional selectivity and differential gene expression. In this mini-review, we discuss the complexity of FSHR-mediated intracellular signals activated in response to ligand stimulation. A better understanding of the signaling pathways involved in FSH action might potentially influence the development of new therapeutic strategies for reproductive disorders.},

	title = {Human {Adipocytes}: {Dopamine} {Receptors} and the {Regulation} of {Prolactin}},
	shorttitle = {Human {Adipocytes}},
	abstract = {Prolactin (PRL) in humans is produced by both the pituitary and extrapituitary sites, where it acts as a cytokine. We previously found that human adipose tissue from several depots produces and secretes  PRL.  PRL  has  multiple  functions  in  adipose  tissue,  including  regulation  of  adipokine release  and  inhibition  of  lipolysis,  but  the  factors  that  control  its  production  are  unknown. Although  dopamine  (DA)  is  the  primary  inhibitor  of pituitary  PRL,  it  has  not  been  previously considered  a  suppressor  of  extrapituitary  PRL.  DA  binds  to  five  receptors  (DAR)  classified  as those  that  stimulate  (D1R  and  D5R)  or  inhibit  (D2R,  D3R  and  D4R)  adenylate  cyclase  and cAMP  accumulation.  However,  expression  of  DAR  in  adipocytes  has  not  been  reported.  Most DA in serum is in the  form of dopamine sulfate (DA-S), which  can be de-conjugated back into DA by arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Our objectives were to: a) evaluate PRL release over time from visceral (vis) and subcutaneous (sc)  adipose  tissue  and  mature  adipocytes  from  both  non-obese  and  obese  patients,  b)  compare the  regulation  of  PRL  production  by  cAMP  activators,  insulin  and  selected  cytokines  from primary  adipocytes  and  LS14  cells  before  and  after differentiation,  c)  examine  whether  human adipose tissue and adipocytes express functional DAR, d) identify the source of DA for adipose tissue by analyzing ARSA expression and activity as well as the effect of DA-S in adipocytes, e) determine  whether  DA  inhibits  PRL  production,  and  f)  examine  whether  DA  regulates  other adipocyte functions, including lipolysis and leptin release. We  found  a  delayed  rise  in  PRL  release  from  both  vis  and  sc  adipose  tissue  and  mature adipocytes cultured in vitro, suggesting removal from an endogenous inhibitor. PRL release from sc adipose tissue was inversely related to BMI. While insulin inhibited PRL gene expression and release  in  differentiated  adipocytes,  it  stimulated  PRL  production  in  undifferentiated  cells. Activators of cAMP induced PRL secretion in both cells types. DAR was expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in adipose tissue and adipocytes. The ratio of DAR expression varied throughout  differentiation  of  primary  preadipocytes  and  two  human  adipocyte  cell-lines,  LS14 and  SW872.  Adipocytes  expressed  ARSA,  whose  activity  was  elevated  after  differentiation. Acting via the D2R, DA suppressed intracellular cAMP accumulation and PRL gene expression and  release  from  adipocytes.  Utilizing  D1-like  receptors,  DA  increased  leptin  release  and lipolysis.  DA-S  had  a  similar  effect  as  DA  on  PRL  and  leptin  release  as  well  as  lipolysis, indicating that it can be converted to bioactive DA by ARSA.  In conclusion, this is the first demonstration of functional DAR and ARSA in human adipocytes. These results suggest that adipocyte DAR are involved in normal metabolic homeostasis and the weight gain associated with antipsychotic medications that antagonize the D2R. PRL appears to be an important adipokine whose release is controlled by insulin and DA and is associated with body weight regulation.},

We used the complete set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterozygous deletion strains to survey the genome for haploinsufficiency via fitness profiling in rich (YPD) and minimal media to identify all genes that confer a haploinsufficient growth defect. This assay revealed that approximately 3\% of all approximately 5900 genes tested are haploinsufficient for growth in YPD. This class of genes is functionally enriched for metabolic processes carried out by molecular complexes such as the ribosome. Much of the haploinsufficiency in YPD is alleviated by slowing the growth rate of each strain in minimal media, suggesting that certain gene products are rate limiting for growth only in YPD. Overall, our results suggest that the primary mechanism of haploinsufficiency in yeast is due to insufficient protein production. We discuss the relevance of our findings in yeast to human haploinsufficiency disorders.},

Genomic imprints are erased in primordial germ cells, newly established during later stages of germ cell development, and stably inherited through somatic cell divisions during postzygotic development. Defects in imprint erasure, establishment, or maintenance result in a paternal chromosome carrying a maternal imprint or in a maternal chromosome carrying a paternal imprint. A wrong imprint leads to activation of an allele that should be silent or silencing of an allele that should be active. Since the dosage of imprinted genes is very important for development and growth, imprinting defects lead to specific diseases. Imprinting defects can occur spontaneously without any DNA sequence change (primary imprinting defect) or as the result of a mutation in a cis-regulatory element or a trans-acting factor (secondary imprinting defect). The distinction between primary and secondary imprinting defects is important for assessing the recurrence risk in affected families. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Moreover, next to a continuous mode of gene duplication, in many eukaryotic organisms the complete genome has been duplicated in their evolutionary past. Such large-scale gene duplication events have been associated with important evolutionary transitions or major leaps in development and adaptive radiations of species. Here, we present an evolutionary model that simulates the duplication dynamics of genes, considering genome-wide duplication events and a continuous mode of gene duplication. Modeling the evolution of the different functional categories of genes assesses the importance of different duplication events for gene families involved in specific functions or processes. By applying our model to the Arabidopsis genome, for which there is compelling evidence for three whole-genome duplications, we show that gene loss is strikingly different for large-scale and small-scale duplication events and highly biased toward certain functional classes. We provide evidence that some categories of genes were almost exclusively expanded through large-scale gene duplication events. In particular, we show that the three whole-genome duplications in Arabidopsis have been directly responsible for {\textgreater}90\% of the increase in transcription factors, signal transducers, and developmental genes in the last 350 million years. Our evolutionary model is widely applicable and can be used to evaluate different assumptions regarding small- or large-scale gene duplication events in eukaryotic genomes.},

	abstract = {The glycoprotein follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) acts on gonadal target cells, hence regulating gametogenesis. The transduction of the hormone-induced signal is mediated by the FSH-specific G protein-coupled receptor (FSHR), of which the action relies on the interaction with a number of intracellular effectors. The stimulatory Gαs protein is a long-time known transducer of FSH signaling, mainly leading to intracellular cAMP increase and protein kinase A (PKA) activation, the latter acting as a master regulator of cell metabolism and sex steroid production. While in vivo data clearly demonstrate the relevance of PKA activation in mediating gametogenesis by triggering proliferative signals, some in vitro data suggest that pro-apoptotic pathways may be awakened as a "dark side" of cAMP/PKA-dependent steroidogenesis, in certain conditions. P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are players of death signals in steroidogenic cells, involving downstream p53 and caspases. Although it could be hypothesized that pro-apoptotic signals, if relevant, may be required for regulating atresia of non-dominant ovarian follicles, they should be transient and counterbalanced by mitogenic signals upon FSHR interaction with opposing transducers, such as Gαi proteins and β-arrestins. These molecules modulate the steroidogenic pathway via extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), calcium signaling and other intracellular signaling effectors, resulting in a complex and dynamic signaling network characterizing sex- and stage-specific gamete maturation. Even if the FSH-mediated signaling network is not yet entirely deciphered, its full comprehension is of high physiological and clinical relevance due to the crucial role covered by the hormone in regulating human development and reproduction.},

One development is regarding analyses of imprinted genes, in which recent work suggests the possibility that intriguing networks of imprinted genes exist and are important for genetic and physiological studies. Another issue that has been raised in recent years by a number of publications is the question of how skewed allelic expression should be for it to be designated as monoallelic expression and, further, what methods are appropriate or inappropriate for analyzing genomic data to examine allele-specific expression. Perhaps the most exciting recent development in mammalian monoallelic expression is a clever and carefully executed analysis of genetic diversity of autosomal genes subject to random monoallelic expression (RMAE), which provides compelling evidence for distinct evolutionary forces acting on random monoallelically expressed genes.},

Recently, it has become possible to test this notion by searching complete genome sequence for signs of ancient duplication. Here, we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arose from ancient whole-genome duplication, by sequencing and analysing Kluyveromyces waltii, a related yeast species that diverged before the duplication. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication. This resolves the long-standing controversy on the ancestry of the yeast genome, and makes it possible to study the fate of duplicated genes directly. Strikingly, 95\% of cases of accelerated evolution involve only one member of a gene pair, providing strong support for a specific model of evolution, and allowing us to distinguish ancestral and derived functions.},

Many polyploids experience extensive and rapid genomic alterations, some arising with the onset of polyploidy. Survivorship of duplicated genes are differential across gene classes, with some duplicate genes more prone to retention than others. Recent theory is now supported by evidence showing that genes that are retained in duplicate typically diversify in function or undergo subfunctionalization.

A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes.

	abstract = {Background: 
Interactions between proteins are key components in the chemical and physical processes of living organisms. Among these interactions, membrane receptors and their ligands are particularly important because they are at the interface between extracellular and intracellular environments. Many studies have investigated how binding partners have co-evolved in genomes during the evolution. However, little is known about the establishment of the interaction on a phylogenetic scale. In this study, we systematically studied the time of birth of genes encoding human membrane receptors and their ligands in the animal tree of life. We examined a total of 553 pairs of ligands/receptors, representing non-redundant interactions.

Results:
We found that 41\% of the receptors and their respective first ligands appeared in the same branch, representing 2.5-fold more than expected by chance, thus suggesting an evolutionary dynamic of interdependence and conservation between these partners. In contrast, 21\% of the receptors appeared after their ligand, i.e. three-fold less often than expected by chance. Most surprisingly, 38\% of the receptors appeared before their first ligand, as much as expected by chance.

Conclusions:
According to these results, we propose that a selective pressure is exerted on ligands and receptors once they appear, that would remove molecules whose partner does not appear quickly.},

La première vient des biotechnologies de la reproduction, de la possibilité de manipuler les embryons et les génomes pour créer des organismes génétiquement modifiés, avec surexpression ou invalidation de gènes. Une autre évolution majeure a été la possibilité de créer des clones de mammifères, chose que l'on croyait impossible avant la naissance de Dolly en 1997.
Les grandes évolutions récentes, depuis les années 2000 sont l'épigénétique, la généralisation du séquençage et du génotypage à haut débit, grâce à de récents progrès technologiques, et à l'utilisation d'outils informatiques de plus en plus puissants. L'accès à ces séquences a grandement accéléré la recherche des gènes responsables de maladies, et plus généralement de phénotypes, "simples" ou complexes, en analysant la co-ségrégation de ces phénotypes dans des familles informatives, avec des marqueurs moléculaires qui balisent l'ensemble des génomes.
Aujourd'hui, l'extrême densité des marqueurs moléculaires permet de faire de la génétique d'association, et de quasiment s'affranchir des familles. Enfin, le séquençage de génomes entiers a également permis de re-dynamiser de "vieilles" sciences passionnantes : la génétique de l'évolution, la physiologie moléculaire comparée et la phylogenèse des grandes fonctions. Il est certain que de nouvelles disciplines nées de nouvelles confrontations verront encore le jour dans un futur proche.

Our results also support Ambulacraria, the pairing of hemichordates with echinoderms (nine proteins; 2,382 amino acids), and Cyclostomata, the pairing of lampreys with hagfish (25 proteins; 6,895 amino acids).

	abstract = {Previously we suggested that four proteins including aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) evolved with approximately constant rates over long periods covering the whole animal phyla. The constant rates of aldolase and TPI evolution were reexamined based on three different models for estimating evolutionary distances. It was shown that the evolutionary rates remain essentially unchanged in comparisons not only between different classes of vertebrates but also between vertebrates and arthropods and even between animals and plants, irrespective of the models used. Thus these enzymes might be useful molecular clocks for inferring divergence times of animal phyla. To know the divergence time of Parazoa and Eumetazoa and that of Cephalochordata and Vertebrata, the aldolase cDNAs from Ephydatia fluviatilis, a freshwater sponge, and the TPI cDNAs from Ephydatia fluviatilis and Branchiostoma belcheri, an amphioxus, have been cloned and se-quenced. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences of aldolase and TPI from the freshwater sponge with known sequences revealed that the Parazoa-Eumetazoa split occurred about 940 million years ago (Ma) as determined by the average of two proteins and three models. Similarly, the aldolase and TPI clocks suggest that vertebrates and amphioxus last shared a common ancestor around 700 Ma and they possibly diverged shortly after the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes.},

Towards this goal, many major nodes have been successfully resolved. However, some major controversies and poorly resolved deep nodes still remain. Here, I discuss some of these controversies (e.g. whether Ctenophora or Porifera is sister group to all other animals), clarify others (e.g. the position of Xenacoelomorpha) and identify major clades that still require resolution. But most importantly, a discussion about the possible conflict in some of these nodes and the relation to the nature of phylogenomic data are provided by exploring the meaning of total support in phylogenomic analyses, highlighting cases in which a data set can provide total support for contradictory nodes. Finally, our efforts should focus on generating genomic data for key candidate taxa, such as the large disparity of undescribed placozoans, which may in the end add to the current data quantity, the quality of data needed to resolve the base of the animal tree.},

	abstract = {Clarifying the phylogeny of animals is fundamental to understanding their evolution. Traditionally, sponges have been considered the sister group of all other extant animals, but recent genomic studies have suggested comb jellies occupy that position instead. Here, we analyzed the current genomic evidence from comb jellies and found no convincing support for this hypothesis. Instead, when analyzed with appropriate methods, recent genomic data support the traditional hypothesis. We conclude that the alternative scenario of animal evolution according to which ctenophores evolved morphological complexity independently from cnidarians and bilaterians or, alternatively, sponges secondarily lost a nervous system, muscles, and other characters, is not supported by the available evidence., Understanding how complex traits, such as epithelia, nervous systems, muscles, or guts, originated depends on a well-supported hypothesis about the phylogenetic relationships among major animal lineages. Traditionally, sponges (Porifera) have been interpreted as the sister group to the remaining animals, a hypothesis consistent with the conventional view that the last common animal ancestor was relatively simple and more complex body plans arose later in evolution. However, this premise has recently been challenged by analyses of the genomes of comb jellies (Ctenophora), which, instead, found ctenophores as the sister group to the remaining animals (the “Ctenophora-sister” hypothesis). Because ctenophores are morphologically complex predators with true epithelia, nervous systems, muscles, and guts, this scenario implies these traits were either present in the last common ancestor of all animals and were lost secondarily in sponges and placozoans (Trichoplax) or, alternatively, evolved convergently in comb jellies. Here, we analyze representative datasets from recent studies supporting Ctenophora-sister, including genome-scale alignments of concatenated protein sequences, as well as a genomic gene content dataset. We found no support for Ctenophora-sister and conclude it is an artifact resulting from inadequate methodology, especially the use of simplistic evolutionary models and inappropriate choice of species to root the metazoan tree. Our results reinforce a traditional scenario for the evolution of complexity in animals, and indicate that inferences about the evolution of Metazoa based on the Ctenophora-sister hypothesis are not supported by the currently available data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The much-debated phylogenetic relationships of the five early branching metazoan lineages (Bilateria, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Placozoa and Porifera) are of fundamental importance in piecing together events that occurred early in animal evolution. Comparisons of gene content between organismal lineages have been identified as a potentially useful methodology for phylogenetic reconstruction. However, these comparisons require complete genomes that, until now, did not exist for the ctenophore lineage. The homeobox superfamily of genes is particularly suited for these kinds of gene content comparisons, since it is large, diverse, and features a highly conserved domain.
RESULTS: We have used a next-generation sequencing approach to generate a high-quality rough draft of the genome of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and subsequently identified a set of 76 homeobox-containing genes from this draft. We phylogenetically categorized this set into established gene families and classes and then compared this set to the homeodomain repertoire of species from the other four early branching metazoan lineages. We have identified several important classes and subclasses of homeodomains that appear to be absent from Mnemiopsis and from the poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica. We have also determined that, based on lineage-specific paralog retention and average branch lengths, it is unlikely that these missing classes and subclasses are due to extensive gene loss or unusually high rates of evolution in Mnemiopsis.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a first glimpse of the first sequenced ctenophore genome. We have characterized the full complement of Mnemiopsis homeodomains from this species and have compared them to species from other early branching lineages. Our results suggest that Porifera and Ctenophora were the first two extant lineages to diverge from the rest of animals. Based on this analysis, we also propose a new name - ParaHoxozoa - for the remaining group that includes Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria.},

The origins of multicellularity are of special interest because they require evolutionary transitions towards increased levels of complexity. We have generated new sequence data from the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA gene (LSU rDNA) and the SSU rDNA gene of several unicellular opisthokont protists – a nucleariid amoeba (Nuclearia simplex) and four choanoﬂagellates (Codosiga gracilis, Choanoeca perplexa, Proterospongia choanojuncta and Stephanoeca diplocostata) to provide the basis for re-examining relationships among several unicellular lineages and their multicellular relatives (animals and fungi). Our data indicate that: (1) choanoﬂagellates are a monophyletic rather than a paraphyletic assemblage that independently gave rise to animals and fungi as suggested by some authors and (2) the nucleariid ﬁlose amoebae are the likely sister group to Fungi.

	abstract = {Molecular co-evolution is manifested by compensatory changes in proteins designed to enable adaptation to their natural environment. In recent years, bioinformatics approaches allowed for the detection of co-evolution at the level of the whole protein or of specific residues. Such efforts enabled prediction of protein–protein interactions, functional assignments of proteins and the identification of interacting residues, thereby providing information on protein structure. Still, despite such advances, relatively little is known regarding the functional implications of sequence divergence resulting from protein co-evolution. While bioinformatics approaches usually analyze thousands of proteins to obtain a broad view of protein co-evolution, experimental evaluation of protein co-evolution serves to study only individual proteins. In this review, we describe recent advances in bioinformatics and experimental efforts aimed at examining protein co-evolution. Accordingly, we discuss possible modes of crosstalk between the bioinformatics and experimental approaches to facilitate the identification of co-evolutionary signals in proteins and to understand their implications for the structure and function of proteins.},

Together, the two resources provide a consistent set of interfaces to genomic data across the tree of life, including reference genome sequence, gene models, transcriptional data, genetic variation and comparative analysis. Data may be accessed via our website, online tools platform and programmatic interfaces, with updates made four times per year (in synchrony with Ensembl). Here, we provide an overview of Ensembl Genomes, with a focus on recent developments. These include the continued growth, more robust and reproducible sets of orthologues and paralogues, and enriched views of gene expression and gene function in plants. Finally, we report on our continued deeper integration with the Ensembl project, which forms a key part of our future strategy for dealing with the increasing quantity of available genome-scale data across the tree of life.},

	abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.

	abstract = {Whole genome duplications (WGD) have now been firmly established in all major eukaryotic kingdoms. In particular, all vertebrates descend from two rounds of WGDs, that occurred in their jawless ancestor some 500 MY ago. Paralogs retained from WGD, also coined ‘ohnologs’ after Susumu Ohno, have been shown to be typically associated with development, signaling and gene regulation. Ohnologs, which amount to about 20 to 35\% of genes in the human genome, have also been shown to be prone to dominant deleterious mutations and frequently implicated in cancer and genetic diseases. Hence, identifying ohnologs is central to better understand the evolution of vertebrates and their susceptibility to genetic diseases. Early computational analyses to identify vertebrate ohnologs relied on content-based synteny comparisons between the human genome and a single invertebrate outgroup genome or within the human genome itself. These approaches are thus limited by lineage specific rearrangements in individual genomes. We report, in this study, the identification of vertebrate ohnologs based on the quantitative assessment and integration of synteny conservation between six amniote vertebrates and six invertebrate outgroups. Such a synteny comparison across multiple genomes is shown to enhance the statistical power of ohnolog identification in vertebrates compared to earlier approaches, by overcoming lineage specific genome rearrangements. Ohnolog gene families can be browsed and downloaded for three statistical confidence levels or recompiled for specific, user-defined, significance criteria at http://ohnologs.curie.fr/. In the light of the importance of WGD on the genetic makeup of vertebrates, our analysis provides a useful resource for researchers interested in gaining further insights on vertebrate evolution and genetic diseases.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is believed to be a significant source of major evolutionary innovation. Redundant genes resulting from WGD are thought to be lost or acquire new functions. However, the rates of gene loss and thus temporal process of genome reshaping after WGD remain unclear. The WGD shared by all teleost fish, one-half of all jawed vertebrates, was more recent than the two ancient WGDs that occurred before the origin of jawed vertebrates, and thus lends itself to analysis of gene loss and genome reshaping. Using a newly developed orthology identification pipeline, we inferred the post–teleost-specific WGD evolutionary histories of 6,892 protein-coding genes from nine phylogenetically representative teleost genomes on a time-calibrated tree. We found that rapid gene loss did occur in the first 60 My, with a loss of more than 70–80\% of duplicated genes, and produced similar genomic gene arrangements within teleosts in that relatively short time. Mathematical modeling suggests that rapid gene loss occurred mainly by events involving simultaneous loss of multiple genes. We found that the subsequent 250 My were characterized by slow and steady loss of individual genes. Our pipeline also identified about 1,100 shared single-copy genes that are inferred to have become singletons before the divergence of clupeocephalan teleosts. Therefore, our comparative genome analysis suggests that rapid gene loss just after the WGD reshaped teleost genomes before the major divergence, and provides a useful set of marker genes for future phylogenetic analysis.},

	abstract = {Teleost fish, which roughly make up half of the extant vertebrate species, exhibit an amazing level of biodiversity affecting their morphology, ecology and behaviour as well as many other aspects of their biology. This huge variability makes fish extremely attractive for the study of many biological questions, particularly of those related to evolution. New insights gained from different teleost species and sequencing projects have recently revealed several peculiar features of fish genomes that might have played a role in fish evolution and speciation. There is now substantial evidence that a round of tetraploidization/rediploidization has taken place during the early evolution of the ray-finned fish lineage, and that hundreds of duplicate pairs generated by this event have been maintained over hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Differential loss or subfunction partitioning of such gene duplicates might have been involved in the generation of fish variability. In contrast to mammalian genomes, teleost genomes also contain multiple families of active transposable elements, which might have played a role in speciation by affecting hybrid sterility and viability. Finally, the amazing diversity of sex determination systems and the plasticity of sex chromosomes observed in teleost might have been involved in both pre- and postmating reproductive isolation. Comparison of data generated by current and future genome projects as well as complementary studies in other species will allow one to approach the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying genome diversity in fish, and will certainly significantly contribute to our understanding of gene evolution and function in humans and other vertebrates.},

Although this assumption is the foundation of comparative genomics and the basis for the use of model organisms to study human biology and disease, its validity is known only from anecdotes rather than from systematic examination. Comparing documented phenotypes of null mutations in humans and mice, we find that {\textgreater}20\% of human essential genes have nonessential mouse orthologs. These changes of gene essentiality appear to be associated with adaptive evolution at the protein-sequence, but not gene-expression, level. Proteins localized to the vacuole, a cellular compartment for waste management, are highly enriched among essentiality-changing genes. It is probable that the evolution of the prolonged life history in humans required enhanced waste management for proper cellular function until the time of reproduction, which rendered these vacuole proteins essential and generated selective pressures for their improvement. If our gene sample represents the entire genome, our results would mean frequent changes of phenotypic effects of one-to-one orthologous genes even between relatively closely related species, a possibility that should be considered in comparative genomic studies and in making cross-species inferences of gene function and phenotypic effect.},

Results: We explore a way to include external information on orthology in the process of gene tree construction.
Given an initial gene tree and a set of orthology constraints on pairs of genes or on clades, we give polynomial-
time algorithms for producing a modified gene tree satisfying the set of constraints, that is as close as possible to the original one according to the Robinson-Foulds distance. We assess the validity of the modifications we propose by computing the likelihood ratio between initial and modified trees according to sequence alignments on Ensembl trees, showing that often the two trees are statistically equivalent.

	abstract = {Genetic dominance has long been considered as a qualitative reflection of interallelic interactions. Dominance arises from many multiple sources whose unifying theme is the existence of non-linear relationships between the genotypic and phenotypic values. One of the clearest examples are dominant negative mutations (DNMs) in which a defective subunit poisons a macromolecular complex. Dominance can also be due to the presence of a heterozygous null allele, as is the case of haploinsufficiency. Dominance can also be influenced by epistatic (interloci) interactions. For instance, a pre-existing genetic variant can make possible the expression of a pathogenic variant in a seemingly “dominant” fashion. Such interactions, which can make an individual more or less sensitive to a particular pathogenic variant, will also be discussed here.},

Predicting the phenotypic consequences of a gene disruption remains a significant challenge. Current approaches employ information from a range of biological networks to predict which human genes are haploinsufficient (meaning two copies are required for normal function) or essential (meaning at least one copy is required for viability). Using recently available study gene sets, we show that these approaches are strongly biased towards providing accurate predictions for well-studied genes. By contrast, we derive a haploinsufficiency score from a combination of unbiased large-scale high-throughput datasets, including gene co-expression and genetic variation in over 6000 human exomes. Our approach provides a haploinsufficiency prediction for over twice as many genes currently unassociated with papers listed in Pubmed as three commonly-used approaches, and outperforms these approaches for predicting haploinsufficiency for less-studied genes. We also show that fine-tuning the predictor on a set of well-studied ‘gold standard’ haploinsufficient genes does not improve the prediction for less-studied genes. This new score can readily be used to prioritize gene disruptions resulting from any genetic variant, including copy number variants, indels and single-nucleotide variants.},

A brief review of the main criteria used by ichthyologists to define their classifications during the last 50 years, however, reveals slow progress towards using an explicit phylogenetic framework. Instead, the trend has been to rely, in varying degrees, on deep-rooted anatomical concepts and authority, often mixing taxa with explicit phylogenetic support with arbitrary groupings. Two leading sources in ichthyology frequently used for fish classifications (JS Nelson’s volumes of Fishes of the World and W. Eschmeyer’s Catalog of Fishes) fail to adopt a global phylogenetic framework despite much recent progress made towards the resolution of the fish Tree of Life. The first explicit phylogenetic classification of bony fishes was published in 2013, based on a comprehensive molecular phylogeny (www.deepfin.org). We here update the first version of that classification by incorporating the most recent phylogenetic results.},

Nous rapportons ici la premiere caracterisation d'une proteine de liaison a la gh dans le plasma de truite arc en ciel (oncorhyncus mykiss) reliee structurellement au recepteur membranaire. Comme l'hormone de croissance, cette proteine est accrue lors du transfert des poissons d'eau douce en eau de mer. La proteine est capable de lier la gh humaine comme la gh de truite arc en ciel. Nous presentons la mise au point de deux techniques de clonage par expression dans des cellules de mammiferes, l'une utilisant des hormones marquees a l'iode 125, qui a permis le clonage du recepteur prolactine du tilapia, l'autre utilisant un promoteur inductible par les hormones lactogeniques. L'utilisation des deux variants de prolactine du tilapia a permis de montrer que le recepteur est active apres dimerisation induite par l'hormone. L'analyse des reponses biologiques associees a chacune de ces deux hormones dans un systeme d'expression mammifere in vitro, a permis de mieux apprehender certains des mecanismes moleculaires a la base des differences observees pour ces deux hormones in vivo. Enfin, des mutants du recepteur, tronques dans le domaine cytoplasmique a permis de montrer que le recepteur prolactine du tilapia utilise jak2 et stat5 pour assurer la transduction du signal hormonal. Il ressort de ce travail que le recepteur prolactine du tilapia possede un mode de fonctionnement equivalent a ceux des mammiferes (dimerisation induite par l'hormone, transduction du signal par jak2 et stat5).},

At the population level, identification of essential genes is accomplished by observing intolerance to loss-of-function variants. Several computational methods are available to score gene essentiality, and recent progress has been made in defining essentiality in the non-coding genome. Haploinsufficiency is emerging as a critical aspect of gene essentiality: approximately 3,000 human genes cannot tolerate loss of one of the two alleles. Genes identified as essential in human cell lines or knockout mice may be distinct from those in living humans. Reconciling these discrepancies in how we evaluate gene essentiality has applications in clinical genetics and may offer insights for drug development.},

	abstract = {Haploinsufficiency, wherein a single functional copy of a gene is insufficient to maintain normal function, is a major cause of dominant disease. Human disease studies have identified several hundred haploinsufficient (HI) genes. We have compiled a map of 1,079 haplosufficient (HS) genes by systematic identification of genes unambiguously and repeatedly compromised by copy number variation among 8,458 apparently healthy individuals and contrasted the genomic, evolutionary, functional, and network properties between these HS genes and known HI genes. We found that HI genes are typically longer and have more conserved coding sequences and promoters than HS genes. HI genes exhibit higher levels of expression during early development and greater tissue specificity. Moreover, within a probabilistic human functional interaction network HI genes have more interaction partners and greater network proximity to other known HI genes. We built a predictive model on the basis of these differences and annotated 12,443 genes with their predicted probability of being haploinsufficient. We validated these predictions of haploinsufficiency by demonstrating that genes with a high predicted probability of exhibiting haploinsufficiency are enriched among genes implicated in human dominant diseases and among genes causing abnormal phenotypes in heterozygous knockout mice. We have transformed these gene-based haploinsufficiency predictions into haploinsufficiency scores for genic deletions, which we demonstrate to better discriminate between pathogenic and benign deletions than consideration of the deletion size or numbers of genes deleted. These robust predictions of haploinsufficiency support clinical interpretation of novel loss-of-function variants and prioritization of variants and genes for follow-up studies.},

Cytokines are secreted glycoproteins that act as intercellular messengers, inducing proliferation, differentiation, growth, or apoptosis of their target cells. They act by binding to specific receptors on the surface of target cells and switching on a phosphotyrosine-based intracellular signaling cascade initiated by kinases then propagated and effected by SH2 domain-containing transcription factors. As cytokine signaling is proliferative and often inflammatory, it is tightly regulated in terms of both amplitude and duration. Here we review molecular details of the cytokine-induced signaling cascade and describe the architectures of the proteins involved, including the receptors, kinases, and transcription factors that initiate and propagate signaling and the regulatory proteins that control it.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two of the main objectives of the genomic and post-genomic era are to structurally and functionally annotate genomes which consists of detecting genes' position and structure, and inferring their function (as well as of other features of genomes). Structural and functional annotation both require the complex chaining of numerous different software, algorithms and methods under the supervision of a biologist. The automation of these pipelines is necessary to manage huge amounts of data released by sequencing projects. Several pipelines already automate some of these complex chaining but still necessitate an important contribution of biologists for supervising and controlling the results at various steps.
RESULTS: Here we propose an innovative automated platform, FIGENIX, which includes an expert system capable to substitute to human expertise at several key steps. FIGENIX currently automates complex pipelines of structural and functional annotation under the supervision of the expert system (which allows for example to make key decisions, check intermediate results or refine the dataset). The quality of the results produced by FIGENIX is comparable to those obtained by expert biologists with a drastic gain in terms of time costs and avoidance of errors due to the human manipulation of data.
CONCLUSION: The core engine and expert system of the FIGENIX platform currently handle complex annotation processes of broad interest for the genomic community. They could be easily adapted to new, or more specialized pipelines, such as for example the annotation of miRNAs, the classification of complex multigenic families, annotation of regulatory elements and other genomic features of interest.},

Together, these provide a comprehensive solution for large-scale and targeted genomics applications alike. Among many other developments over the past year, we have improved our resources for gene regulation and comparative genomics, and added CRISPR/Cas9 target sites. We released new browser functionality and tools, including improved filtering and prioritization of genome variation, Manhattan plot visualization for linkage disequilibrium and eQTL data, and an ontology search for phenotypes, traits and disease. We have also enhanced data discovery and access with a track hub registry and a selection of new REST end points.

Without a systematic catalogue of these data and appropriate query and annotation tools, understanding the genome sequence of an individual and assessing their disease risk is impossible. In Ensembl, we substantially solve this problem: we develop methods to facilitate data integration and broad access; aggregate information in a consistent manner and make it available a variety of standard formats, both visually and programmatically; build analysis pipelines to compare variants to comprehensive genomic annotation sets; and make all tools and data publicly available.},

	abstract = {In the genomic era, one of the fundamental goals is to characterize the function of proteins on a large scale. We describe a method, PANTHER, for relating protein sequence relationships to function relationships in a robust and accurate way. PANTHER is composed of two main components: the PANTHER library (PANTHER/LIB) and the PANTHER index (PANTHER/X). PANTHER/LIB is a collection of “books,” each representing a protein family as a multiple sequence alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree. Functional divergence within the family is represented by dividing the tree into subtrees based on shared function, and by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an abbreviated ontology for summarizing and navigating molecular functions and biological processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We apply PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we report the size and sequence diversity of the families and subfamilies, characterizing the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence across a wide range of protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to give a high-level representation of gene function across the human and mouse genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on a database-wide scale, according to their likelihood of affecting protein function.},

	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1460895/},
	abstract = {It has often been argued that gene-duplication events are most commonly followed by a mutational event that silences one member of the pair, while on rare occasions both members of the pair are preserved as one acquires a mutation with a beneficial function and the other retains the original function. However, empirical evidence from genome duplication events suggests that gene duplicates are preserved in genomes far more commonly and for periods far in excess of the expectations under this model, and whereas some gene duplicates clearly evolve new functions, there is little evidence that this is the most common mechanism of duplicate-gene preservation. An alternative hypothesis is that gene duplicates are frequently preserved by subfunctionalization, whereby both members of a pair experience degenerative mutations that reduce their joint levels and patterns of activity to that of the single ancestral gene. We consider the ways in which the probability of duplicate-gene preservation by such complementary mutations is modified by aspects of gene structure, degree of linkage, mutation rates and effects, and population size. Even if most mutations cause complete loss-of-subfunction, the probability of duplicate-gene preservation can be appreciable if the long-term effective population size is on the order of 10(5) or smaller, especially if there are more than two independently mutable subfunctions per locus. Even a moderate incidence of partial loss-of-function mutations greatly elevates the probability of preservation. The model proposed herein leads to quantitative predictions that are consistent with observations on the frequency of long-term duplicate gene preservation and with observations that indicate that a common fate of the members of duplicate-gene pairs is the partitioning of tissue-specific patterns of expression of the ancestral gene.},

	abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies—a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly—were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional ∼12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

However, it is still unclear how many chemokine receptors exist in the genomes of various vertebrate species other than human and mouse. Moreover, the orthologous relationships are often obscure between the genes of higher and lower vertebrates. In order to provide a basis for a unified nomenclature system of the vertebrate chemokine receptor gene family, we have analysed the chemokine receptor genes from the genomes of 16 vertebrate species, and classify them into 29 orthologous groups using phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses. The results reveal a continuous gene birth and death process during the vertebrate evolution and an interesting evolutionary history of the chemokine receptor genes after the emergence in agnathans.},

In this paper we present an overview and bring some new data on the evolutionary study of reproduction-related genes by integrating phylogeny with gene genomic localization. We focus on the gene evolutionary processes of gene birth, death, and divergence. We show that phylogenetic gene birth is confirmed by gene location in genomes, which definitively localized the "place of birth" of new genes (such as Obox and KHDC1/DPPA5/ECAT1/OOEP gene families). By finding their "place of death" in genomes, it also demonstrates that ZP genes TGM4 and OVGP1 have been lost in certain species during vertebrate evolution. Moreover, in the case of gene divergence, comparison of gene locations across different genomes establishes orthologous relationships that are weakly supported by the phylogenetic tree. Specifically, genomic localization demonstrates that the fish and bird mtnr1c (Mel1C) receptor is orthologous to mammalian GPR50, and that ungulate genomes contain new seminal vesicle-specific BSP genes that are not present in other species. Overall, the phylogenomic approach to gene evolution presented in this paper offers more insight into gene function, such as species-specific duplications for speciation, changes in gene expression due to gene divergence, and functional loss by gene death.},

	abstract = {Notch is a highly conserved family of transmembrane receptors and transcription factors that are key players in several developmental processes. In this study, we identified novel Notch sequences from various species covering from worm to human and conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis in order to confirm and extend the evolutionary history of Notch. Our findings confirm an independent duplication event in Caenorhabditis elegans resulting in two Notch genes and show that the vertebrate Notch genes resulted from two duplication events, both of which occurred before the divergence of teleosts and tetrapoda. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vertebrate Notch2 group is phylogenetically closer to Notch3 and that Notch2 appeared at the first round of vertebrate duplication events. Moreover, there is evidence that the two Notch1 genes in fish, appeared by a recent duplication of Notch1 in teleost after the divergence of teleost and tetrapoda. Whether this is from ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) or gene duplication remains to be elucidated. The fourth group of Notch (Notch4) was found only in mammals. We suggest two possible scenarios for the origin of the Notch4 subfamily: 1) Notch4 appeared at the time of the two WGDs in the early chordate but has been maintained only in the mammalian lineage and was lost in the other lineages, 2) a recent independent duplication event took place in the mammalian lineage. The increase of the sequencing data from Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus genome projects and of other avian and reptile genomes will shed more light on this event. Nevertheless, the great divergence of Notch4, from the other three Notch genes, suggests a rapid divergence raising questions about the functional implication of this event. In addition, comparison of the organization of Notch syntenic genes among species supports the coordinated rearrangements during evolution for Ntch, PBX, and BRD families that may lead to possible functional relationships.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Many cellular functions depend on highly specific intermolecular interactions, with mutational changes in each component of the interaction imposing coevolutionary pressure on the remaining members (e.g., a transcription factor and its DNA binding sites). The conflict between mutation pressure toward reduced affinity and selective pressure for greater interaction results in an evolutionary equilibrium distribution for the affinity between interacting partners. Nevertheless, conditional on the maintenance of a critical level of molecular recognition, the sites containing the key residues of binding interfaces are free to evolve. The theory developed suggests that most such evolution is a simple consequence of random genetic drift and not an outcome of adaptive fine tuning.
          , 
            Many cellular functions depend on highly specific intermolecular interactions, for example transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, microRNAs and their RNA binding sites, the interfaces between heterodimeric protein molecules, the stems in RNA molecules, and kinases and their response regulators in signal-transduction systems. Despite the need for complementarity between interacting partners, such pairwise systems seem to be capable of high levels of evolutionary divergence, even when subject to strong selection. Such behavior is a consequence of the diminishing advantages of increasing binding affinity between partners, the multiplicity of evolutionary pathways between selectively equivalent alternatives, and the stochastic nature of evolutionary processes. Because mutation pressure toward reduced affinity conflicts with selective pressure for greater interaction, situations can arise in which the expected distribution of the degree of matching between interacting partners is bimodal, even in the face of constant selection. Although biomolecules with larger numbers of interacting partners are subject to increased levels of evolutionary conservation, their more numerous partners need not converge on a single sequence motif or be increasingly constrained in more complex systems. These results suggest that most phylogenetic differences in the sequences of binding interfaces are not the result of adaptive fine tuning but a simple consequence of random genetic drift.},

All jawed vertebrates assemble their antigen-receptor genes through recombinatorial rearrangement of different immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene segments. The surviving jawless vertebrates, lampreys and hagfish, instead solved the receptor diversification problem by the recombinatorial assembly of leucine-rich-repeat genetic modules to encode variable lymphocyte receptors. The convergent evolution of these remarkably different adaptive immune systems involved innovative genetic modification of innate-immune-system components.},

Although the majority of cell signaling principles were initially derived from hormonal studies, its exponential growth has been supported by interdisciplinary inputs, e.g., from physics, chemistry, mathematics, statistics, and computational fields. As a result, cell signaling has grown out of scope for any general review. Here, we review how the messages are transferred from the first messenger (the ligand) to the receptor, and then decoded with the help of cascades of second messengers (kinases, phosphatases, GTPases, ions, and small molecules such as cAMP, cGMP, diacylglycerol, etc.). The message is thus relayed from the membrane to the nucleus where gene expression ns, subsequent translations, and protein targeting to the cell membrane and other organelles are triggered. Although there are limited numbers of intracellular messengers, the specificity of the response profiles to the ligands is generated by the involvement of a combination of selected intracellular signaling intermediates. Other crucial parameters in cell signaling are its directionality and distribution of signaling strengths in different pathways that may crosstalk to adjust the amplitude and quality of the final effector output. Finally, we have reflected upon its possible developments during the coming years.},

We demonstrate that orphan receptors are randomly distributed in the evolutionary tree and that there is no relationship between the position of a given liganded receptor in the tree and the chemical nature of its ligand. NRs are specific to metazoans, as revealed by a screen of NR-related sequences in early- and non-metazoan organisms. The analysis of the NR gene duplication pattern during the evolution of metazoans shows that the present NR diversity arose from two waves of gene duplications. Strikingly, our results suggest that the ancestral NR was an orphan receptor that acquired ligand-binding ability during subsequent evolution.},

In addition to targeting cell adhesion to specific extracellular matrix proteins and ligands on adjacent cells, these receptors influence many diverse processes including cellular growth, differentiation, junction formation, and polarity. Several families of adhesion receptors have been identified. These include: 1) the integrins, heterodimeric molecules that function both as cell-substratum and cell-cell adhesion receptors; 2) the adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion and especially important during embryo-genesis, wound healing, and the inflammatory response; 3) the cadherins, developmentally regulated, calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion proteins; 4) the LEC-CAMs, cell adhesion molecules with lectin-like domains that mediate white blood cell/endothelial cell adhesion; and 5) homing receptors that target lymphocytes to specific lymphoid tissue. In this review we summarize recent data describing the structure and function of some of these cell adhesion molecules (with special emphasis on the integrin family) and discuss the possible role of these molecules in development, inflammation, wound healing, coagulation, and tumor metastasis.},

The reliability of the phylogenetic trees was probed with the bootstrapping test. Our results indicated that: both the alpha- and beta-subunits of the family diverged from a common ancestral gene about 927 million years ago, the initial precursor of the beta-subunit duplicated to give rise to the LH beta and a second hormone, the latter then duplicating to FSH beta and TSH beta, so that FSH beta is related more to TSH beta than to LH beta; and bony fish GTH-I beta is highly related to mammalian FSH beta, whereas the bony fish GTH-II beta is more related to mammalian LH beta. For scientific consistency and convenience, we propose that the following nomenclature be adopted, all fish gonadotropins of type I be classified as FSH and all type II be classified as LH hormones. In addition, on the basis of results from this and other studies, we propose an evolutionary history for this glycoprotein hormone family. Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of this family would not only provide clues to understanding thyrotropin and gonadotropin functions, but would also allow further revision of the present nomenclature of the gonadotropins in fish.},

We report that 125I-labeled f-Alb (125I-f-Alb) binding to human placental brush-border membranes also occurs. This binding reached equilibrium within 40 min at 37 degrees C. Kinetic studies demonstrated the presence of saturable binding with an apparent Kd of 2.1 micrograms of f-Alb/ml and a maximal binding of 2.3 micrograms/mg of membrane protein at pH 7.5. Maximal binding was observed at between pH 7.5 and 8.0. 125I-f-Alb binding to the membranes was little inhibited by a 1000-fold molar excess of ovalbumin, human apo-transferrin and native bovine serum albumin. No binding was observed with membranes which had been pretreated with proteinase or trypsin. This f-Alb receptor was extremely heat-stable, since the binding was not abolished even by pretreatment of the membranes at 78 degrees C for 30 min. EDTA, Ca2+ and Mg/4 had no effect on 125I-f-Alb binding, so the binding was independent of divalent cations. These data suggest that a receptor specific for f-Alb exists on human placental brush-border membranes of syncytial trophoblasts.},

	abstract = {The evolution of novelty in tightly integrated biological systems, such as hormones and their receptors, seems to challenge the theory of natural selection: it has not been clear how a new function for any one part (such as a ligand) can be selected for unless the other members of the system (e.g., a receptor) are already present. Here I show-based on identification and phylogenetic analysis of steroid receptors in basal vertebrates and reconstruction of the sequences and functional attributes of ancestral proteins-that the first steroid receptor was an estrogen receptor, followed by a progesterone receptor. Genome mapping and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the full complement of mammalian steroid receptors evolved from these ancient receptors by two large-scale genome expansions, one before the advent of jawed vertebrates and one after. Specific regulation of physiological processes by androgens and corticoids are relatively recent innovations that emerged after these duplications. These findings support a model of ligand exploitation in which the terminal ligand in a biosynthetic pathway is the first for which a receptor evolves; selection for this hormone also selects for the synthesis of intermediates despite the absence of receptors, and duplicated receptors then evolve affinity for these substances. In this way, novel hormone-receptor pairs are created, and an integrated system of increasing complexity elaborated. This model suggests that ligands for some "orphan" receptors may be found among intermediates in the synthesis of ligands for phylogenetically related receptors.},

	doi = {10.1677/jme.0.0190207},
	abstract = {From a database containing the published nuclear hormone receptor (NR) sequences I constructed an alignment of the C, D and E domains of these molecules. Using this alignment, I have performed tree reconstruction using both distance matrix and parsimony analysis. The robustness of each branch was estimated using bootstrap resampling methods. The trees constructed by these two methods gave congruent topologies. From these analyses I defined six NR subfamilies: (i) a large one clustering thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and ecdysone receptors (EcRs) as well as numerous orphan receptors such as RORs or Rev-erbs; (ii) one containing retinoid X receptors (RXRs) together with COUP, HNF4, tailless, TR2 and TR4 orphan receptors; (iii) one containing steroid receptors; (iv) one containing the NGFIB orphan receptors; (v) one containing FTZ-F1 orphan receptors; and finally (vi) one containing to date only one gene, the GCNF1 orphan receptor. The relationships between the six subfamilies are not known except for subfamilies I and IV which appear to be related. Interestingly, most of the liganded receptors appear to be derived when compared with orphan receptors. This suggests that the ligand-binding ability of NRs has been gained by orphan receptors during the course of evolution to give rise to the presently known receptors. The distribution into six subfamilies correlates with the known abilities of the various NRs to bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers. For example, receptors heterodimerizing efficiently with RXR belong to the first or the fourth subfamilies. I suggest that the ability to heterodimerize evolved once, just before the separation of subfamilies I and IV and that the first NR was able to bind to DNA as a homodimer. From the study of NR sequences existing in vertebrates, arthropods and nematodes, I define two major steps of NR diversification: one that took place very early, probably during the multicellularization event leading to all the metazoan phyla, and a second occurring later on, corresponding to the advent of vertebrates. Finally, I show that in vertebrate species the various groups of NRs accumulated mutations at very different rates.},

Here we present a phylogenetic analysis that shows that the GnRH genes fall naturally into three distinct branches, each of which shares not only a molecular signature but also characteristic expression sites in the brain. The GnRH genes appear to have arisen through gene duplication from a single ancestral GnRH whose origin predates vertebrates. Several lines of data support this suggestion, including the fact that all three genes share an identical exonic structure. The existence of three distinct GnRH families suggests a new, natural nomenclature for the genes, and in addition, we present a logical proposal for naming the peptide sequences. The two recently discovered GnRH genes are unusual because they encode decapeptides that are identical in all the species in which they have been found. The control of gene expression also differs among the three gene families as might be expected since they have had separate evolutionary trajectories for perhaps 500 million years.},

However, because metabolic pathways are inherited by descent with modification, their structure can be compared using cladistic analysis. Using this approach, we studied the evolution of steroid hormones. We show that side-chain cleavage is common to most vertebrate steroids, whereas aromatization was co-opted for estrogen synthesis from a more ancient pathway. The ancestral products of aromatic activity were aromatized steroids with a side chain, which we named "paraestrols." We synthesized paraestrol A and show that it effectively binds and activates the ancestral steroid receptor. Our study opens the way to comparative studies of biologically active small molecules.},

	abstract = {Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve. The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences.},

Slowly evolving proteins or sites within proteins were assumed to be more functionally important and thus subject to stronger selection pressure. More recently, biophysical models of protein evolution, which combine evolutionary theory with protein biophysics, have completely revolutionized our view of the forces that shape sequence divergence. Slowly evolving proteins have been found to evolve slowly because of selection against toxic mis-folding and misinteractions, linking their rate of evolution primarily to their abundance. Similarly, most slowly evolving sites in proteins are not directly involved in function, but mutating them has large impacts on protein structure and stability. Here, we review the studies of the emergent field of biophysical protein evolution that have shaped our current understanding of sequence divergence patterns. We also propose future research directions to develop this nascent field.},

However, to what extent functional sites impose evolutionary constraints on nearby or even more distant residues is not known. Here, we report pervasive conservation gradients toward catalytic residues in a dataset of 524 distinct enzymes: evolutionary conservation decreases approximately linearly with increasing distance to the nearest catalytic residue in the protein structure. This trend encompasses, on average, 80\% of the residues in any enzyme, and it is independent of known structural constraints on protein evolution such as residue packing or solvent accessibility. Further, the trend exists in both monomeric and multimeric enzymes and irrespective of enzyme size and/or location of the active site in the enzyme structure. By contrast, sites in protein-protein interfaces, unlike catalytic residues, are only weakly conserved and induce only minor rate gradients. In aggregate, these observations show that functional sites, and in particular catalytic residues, induce long-range evolutionary constraints in enzymes.},

Here, we show that membrane proteins have dramatically fewer detectable orthologs than water-soluble proteins, less than half in most species analyzed. This sparse distribution could reflect rapid divergence or gene loss. We find that both mechanisms operate. First, membrane proteins evolve faster than water-soluble proteins, particularly in their exterior-facing portions. Second, we demonstrate that predicted ancestral membrane proteins are preferentially lost compared with water-soluble proteins in closely related species of archaea and bacteria. These patterns are consistent across the whole tree of life, and in each of the three domains of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Our findings point to a fundamental evolutionary principle: membrane proteins evolve faster due to stronger adaptive selection in changing environments, whereas cytosolic proteins are under more stringent purifying selection in the homeostatic interior of the cell. This effect should be strongest in prokaryotes, weaker in unicellular eukaryotes (with intracellular membranes), and weakest in multicellular eukaryotes (with extracellular homeostasis). We demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Similarly, we show that extracellular water-soluble proteins exhibit an even stronger pattern of low homology than membrane proteins. These striking differences in conservation of membrane proteins versus water-soluble proteins have important implications for evolution and medicine.},

To resolve this issue, we have used an in silico genomic data mining tool to identify the real putative peptide GPCRs in the C. elegans genome and then made a well-considered selection of orphan peptide GPCRs. To maximize our chances of a successful deorphanization, we adopted a combined reverse pharmacology approach. At this moment, we have successfully uncovered four C. elegans neuropeptide signaling systems that support the theory of receptor-ligand coevolution. All four systems are extremely well conserved within nematodes and show a high degree of similarity with their vertebrate and arthropod counterparts. Our data indicate that these four neuropeptide signaling systems have been well conserved during the course of evolution and that they were already well established prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes.},

Analysis of metazoan nucleotide and protein sequences reveals a patchwork pattern of H-P-PG gene conservation between vertebrates and closely related invertebrates (ascidians). This is consistent with a model of how the vertebrate H-P-PG endocrine system could have emerged in relatively few steps by gene family expansion and by regulatory and structural modifications to genes that are present in a chordate ancestor. Some of these changes might have resulted in new connections between metabolic or signaling pathways, such as the bridging of 'synthesis islands' to form an efficient system for steroid hormone synthesis.},

Such set-centric features address a host of applications, including microarray data analysis, cross-database annotation mapping and gene-disorder associations for drug targeting. We highlight the new Version 3 database architecture, its multi-faceted search engine, and its semi-automated quality assurance system. Data enhancements include an expanded visualization of gene expression patterns in normal and cancer tissues, an integrated alternative splicing pattern display, and augmented multi-source SNPs and pathways sections. GeneCards now provides direct links to gene-related research reagents such as antibodies, recombinant proteins, DNA clones and inhibitory RNAs and features gene-related drugs and compounds lists.

Here we use a simple model to investigate the relationship between the stability requirement and the capacity of a protein to evolve the function of binding to a ligand. Although our model contains no built-in tradeoff between stability and function, proteins evolved function more efficiently when the stability requirement was relaxed. Proteins with both high stability and high function evolved more efficiently when the stability requirement was gradually increased than when there was constant selection for high stability. These results show that in our model, the evolution of function is enhanced by allowing proteins to explore sequences corresponding to marginally stable structures, and that it is easier to improve stability while maintaining high function than to improve function while maintaining high stability. Our model also demonstrates that even in the absence of a fundamental biophysical tradeoff between stability and function, the speed with which function can evolve is limited by the stability requirement imposed on the protein.},

Here, we show that the expression levels of physically interacting proteins coevolve. We estimate average expression levels of genes from four closely related fungi of the genus Saccharomyces using the codon adaptation index and show that expression levels of interacting proteins exhibit coordinated changes in these different species. We find that this coevolution of expression is a more powerful predictor of physical interaction than is coevolution of amino acid sequence. These results demonstrate that gene expression levels can coevolve, adding another dimension to the study of the coevolution of interacting proteins and underscoring the importance of maintaining coexpression of interacting proteins over evolutionary time.

They are the result of specific interactions between protein interfaces and are maintained by the action of evolutionary pressure on the regions of the interacting proteins that contribute to binding. For the most part, selection restricts amino acid replacements, accounting for the conservation of binding interfaces. However, in some cases, change in one protein will be mitigated by compensatory change in its binding partner, maintaining function in the face of evolutionary change. There have been several attempts to use correlations in sequence evolution to predict interactions of proteins. Most commonly, these approaches use the entire sequence to identify correlations and so infer probable binding. However, other factors such as shared evolutionary history and similarities in the rates of evolution confound these whole-sequence-based approaches. Here, we discuss recent work on this topic and argue that both site-specific coevolutionary change and whole-sequence evolution contribute to evolutionary signals in sets of interacting proteins. We discuss the relative effects of both types of selection and how they might be identified. This permits an integrated view of protein-protein interactions, their evolution, and coevolution.},

	abstract = {Recent work with approaches like recombinant mutants and X-ray crystallography has given much new information about the ligand-binding properties of human serum albumin (HSA). The information increases the understanding of this unique transport and depot protein and could give a structural basis for the possible construction of therapeutic agents with altered HSA-binding properties. A tabulation of high-affinity binding sites for both endogenous and exogenous compounds has been made; it could be useful for the above-mentioned purpose, but it could also be of value when trying to predict potential drug interactions at the protein-binding level. Drug displacement is not always a complication to therapy; it can be used to increase the biological effect of a drug. However, due to rebinding at other sites, the increase in the free concentration of a displaced ligand can be less than expected. Drugs and drug metabolites can also interact covalently with HSA; thiol-containing drugs often bind to the single free cysteine residue of HSA, and glucuronidated drugs react irreversibly with other residues of the protein. Reversible binding of ligands is often stereospecific, and therefore immobilized HSA can be used to separate drug isomers. Albumin-containing dialysates are useful for extracorporeal removal of endogenous toxins and in the treatment of drug overdoses. HSA has different types of hydrolytic activities, which also can be stereospecific. The esterase-like property seems especially useful in converting prodrugs to active drugs in plasma.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes recent advances and novel concepts in the area of insect reproductive neuroendocrinology. The role of 'classic' hormones, such as ecdysteroids and juvenoids, to control reproduction is well documented in a large variety of insect species. In adult gonads, ecdysteroids appear to induce a cascade of transcription factors, many of which also occur during the larval molting response. Recent molecular and functional data have created opportunities to study an additional level of regulation, that of neuropeptides, growth factors and their respective receptors. As a result, many homologs of factors playing a role in vertebrate reproductive physiology have been discovered in insects. This review highlights several neuropeptides controlling the biosynthesis and release of the 'classic' insect hormones, as well as various peptides and biogenic amines that regulate behavioural aspects of the reproduction process. In addition, hormone metabolizing enzymes and second messenger pathways are discussed with respect to their role in reproductive tissues. Finally, we speculate on future prospects for insect neuroendocrinological research as a consequence of the recent 'Genomics Revolution'.},

Although the majority of these cSNPs are assumed not to be disease-causing (nDCs), experimental data on their functional impact are lacking. Here, we have computationally analyzed the distribution of 454 cSNPs within the GPCR gene family and have found that disease-causing cSNPs (DCs) are overrepresented, whereas nDCs are underrepresented or neutral in transmembrane and extracellular loop domains, respectively.

Using comparative genomic analyses, we have reconstructed the evolutionary history of the endothelin system, a signaling pathway consisting of endothelin ligands and their G protein-coupled receptors. The endothelin system plays a key role in cardiovascular regulation as well as in the development of diverse neural crest derivatives like pigment cells and craniofacial bone structures, which are hot spots of diversity in vertebrates. However, little is known about the origin and evolution of the endothelin system in the vertebrate lineage. We show that the endothelin core system, that is, endothelin ligands (Edn) and their receptors (Ednr), is a vertebrate-specific innovation. The components of the endothelin core system in modern vertebrate genomes date back to single genes that have been duplicated during whole-genome duplication events. After two rounds of genome duplication during early vertebrate evolution, the endothelin system of an ancestral gnathostome consisted of four ligand and four receptor genes. The previously unknown fourth endothelin ligand Edn4 has been kept in teleost fish but lost in tetrapods. Bony vertebrates generally possess three receptor genes, EdnrA, EdnrB1, and EdnrB2. EdnrB2 has been lost secondarily in the mammalian lineage from a chromosome that gave rise to the sex chromosomes in therians (marsupials and placentals). The endothelin system of fishes was further expanded by a fish-specific genome duplication and duplicated edn2, edn3, ednrA, and ednrB1 genes have been retained in teleost fishes. Functional divergence analyses suppose that following each round of genome duplication, coevolution of ligands and their binding regions in the receptors has occurred, adjusting the endothelin signaling system to the increase of possible ligand-receptor interactions. Furthermore, duplications of genes involved in the endothelin system are associated with functional specialization for the development of particular neural crest derivatives. Our results support an important role for newly emerging ligands and receptors as components of signaling pathways and their expansion through genome duplications in the evolution of the vertebrate neural crest.},

Interactions in STRING are provided with a confidence score, and accessory information such as protein domains and 3D structures is made available, all within a stable and consistent identifier space. New features in STRING include an interactive network viewer that can cluster networks on demand, updated on-screen previews of structural information including homology models, extensive data updates and strongly improved connectivity and integration with third-party resources.

We confirmed the results of earlier studies that there remains little signal of these events in numbers of duplicated genes, gene tree topology, or the number of genes per multigene family. However, when we plotted the genomic map positions of only the subset of paralogous genes that were duplicated prior to the fish-tetrapod split, their global physical organization provides unmistakable evidence of two distinct genome duplication events early in vertebrate evolution indicated by clear patterns of four-way paralogous regions covering a large part of the human genome.

However, uncovering these constraints remains a challenge, and the description and detection of evolutionary signals in protein-protein interactions is currently a very active field of research. Here, we review recent works dissecting the mechanisms of protein-protein interaction evolution and exploring how to use evolutionary information to predict interactions, both at the global level of the interactome and at the detailed level of protein-protein interfaces. We first present to what extent protein-protein interactions are found to be conserved within interactomes and which properties can influence their conservation. We then discuss the evolutionary and co-evolutionary pressures applied on protein-protein interfaces. Finally, we describe how the computational prediction of interfaces can benefit from evolutionary inputs.},

Here, the ligand for an orphan G protein-coupled receptor in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce-PK-R) was found using a bioinformatics approach. After cloning and expressing Ce-PK-R in HEK293T cells, we found that it was activated by a neuropeptide from the C. elegans NLP-44 precursor (EC(50)=18nM). This neuropeptide precursor is reminiscent of insect CAPA precursors since it encodes a PK-like peptide and two periviscerokinin-like peptides (PVKs). Analogous to CAPA peptides in insects and NMUs in vertebrates, whole mount immunostaining in C. elegans revealed that the CAPA precursor is expressed in the nervous system. The present data also suggest that the ancestral CAPA precursor was already present in the common ancestor of Protostomians and Deuterostomians and that it might have been duplicated into CAPA and HUGIN in insects.

Our phylogenetic analysis of these receptors revealed 29 well-supported subtrees containing mixed sets of protostomian and deuterostomian sequences. This indicated that many vertebrate and arthropod PSs that were previously thought to be phyla specific are in fact of bilaterian origin. By screening sequence databases for potential peptides, we then reconstructed entire bilaterian peptide families and showed that protostomian and deuterostomian peptides that are ligands of orthologous receptors displayed some similarity at the level of their primary sequence, suggesting an ancient coevolution between peptide and receptor genes. In addition to shedding light on the function of human G protein-coupled receptor PSs, this work presents orthology markers to study ancestral neuron types that were probably present in the last common bilaterian ancestor.},

Surveys of very divergent proteins from model organisms, however, are often insufficient to determine the features of ancestral proteins and to reveal the evolutionary events that yielded extant diversity. Here we combine genomic, biochemical, functional, structural, and phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct the early evolution of nuclear receptors (NRs), a diverse superfamily of transcriptional regulators that play key roles in animal development, physiology, and reproduction. By inferring the structure and functions of the ancestral NR, we show--contrary to current belief--that NRs evolved from a ligand-activated ancestral receptor that existed near the base of the Metazoa, with fatty acids as possible ancestral ligands. Evolutionary tinkering with this ancestral structure generated the extraordinary diversity of modern receptors: sensitivity to different ligands evolved because of subtle modifications of the internal cavity, and ligand-independent activation evolved repeatedly because of various mutations that stabilized the active conformation in the absence of ligand. Our findings illustrate how a mechanistic dissection of protein evolution in a phylogenetic context can reveal the deep homology that links apparently "novel" molecular functions to a common ancestral form.},

In order to investigate this, the sequence identities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) proteins to their Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SP) orthologues were used as a measure of sequence divergence. The SC proteins were divided into those in stable complexes, those that participate in transient interactions and the remaining proteins. All types of proteins can undergo extensive divergence: all three sequence identity distributions range from less than 20 to over 90\%. However, overall, protein interactions do place additional constraints on sequence divergence and the distributions differ significantly: proteins not known to be involved in interactions have an average sequence identity of 38\% while this value is 46\% for proteins in stable complexes. Proteins that have transient interactions are intermediate between the two, with an average sequence identity of 41\%. This trend is independent of whether the proteins are involved in informational functions (transcription, translation and replication) or not and of protein dispensability.},

Using branching order in the phylogenetic trees, we timed gene duplication events in these families relative to the primate-rodent divergence, the amniote-amphibian divergence, and the deuterostome-protostome divergence. The results showed similar patterns of gene duplication times within duplicated blocks and outside duplicated blocks. Both within and outside duplicated blocks, numerous duplications were timed prior to the deuterostome-protostome divergence, whereas others occurred after the amniote-amphibian divergence. Thus, neither gene duplication in general nor duplication of genomic blocks could be attributed entirely to polyploidization early in vertebrate history. The strongest signal in the data was a tendency for intrachromosomal duplications to be more recent than interchromosomal duplications, consistent with a model whereby tandem duplication-whether of single genes or of genomic blocks-may be followed by eventual separation of duplicates due to chromosomal rearrangements. The rate of separation of tandemly duplicated gene pairs onto separated chromosomes in the human lineage was estimated at 1.7 x 10(-9) per gene-pair per year.},

Present in both cnidarians and bilaterians, neuropeptides represent an ancient and widespread mode of neuronal communication. Due to the inherent difficulties of analyzing highly diverse and repetitive pNPs, the relationships among different families are often elusive. Using similarity-based clustering and sensitive similarity searches, I obtained a global view of metazoan pNP diversity and evolution. Clustering revealed a large and diffuse network of sequences connected by significant sequence similarity encompassing one-quarter of all families. pNPs belonging to this cluster were also identified in the early-branching neuronless animal Trichoplax adhaerens. Clustering of neuropeptide GPCRs identified several orthology groups and allowed the reconstruction of the phyletic distribution of receptor families. GPCR phyletic distribution closely paralleled that of pNPs, indicating extensive conservation and long-term coevolution of receptor-ligand pairs. Receptor orthology and intermediate sequences also revealed the homology of pNPs so far considered unrelated, including allatotropin and orexin. These findings, together with the identification of deuterostome achatin and luqin and protostome opioid pNPs, extended the neuropeptide complement of the urbilaterian. Several pNPs were also identified from the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii and the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae, elucidating pNP evolution in deuterostomes. Receptor-ligand conservation also allowed ligand predictions for many uncharacterized GPCRs from nonmodel species. The reconstruction of the neuropeptide-signaling repertoire at deep nodes of the animal phylogeny allowed the formulation of a testable scenario of the evolution of animal neuroendocrine systems.},

	abstract = {Five families of neuropeptides that have a C-terminal RFamide motif have been identified in vertebrates: (1) gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), (2) neuropeptide FF (NPFF), (3) pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (QRFP), (4) prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), and (5) Kisspeptin. Experimental demonstration of neuropeptide-receptor pairings combined with comprehensive analysis of genomic and/or transcriptomic sequence data indicate that, with the exception of the deuterostomian PrRP system, the evolutionary origins of these neuropeptides can be traced back to the common ancestor of bilaterians. Here, we review the occurrence of homologs of vertebrate RFamide-type neuropeptides and their receptors in deuterostomian invertebrates - urochordates, cephalochordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms. Extending analysis of the occurrence of the RFamide motif in other bilaterian neuropeptide families reveals RFamide-type peptides that have acquired modified C-terminal characteristics in the vertebrate lineage (e.g., NPY/NPF), neuropeptide families where the RFamide motif is unique to protostomian members (e.g., CCK/sulfakinins), and RFamide-type peptides that have been lost in the vertebrate lineage (e.g., luqins). Furthermore, the RFamide motif is also a feature of neuropeptide families with a more restricted phylogenetic distribution (e.g., the prototypical FMRFamide-related neuropeptides in protostomes). Thus, the RFamide motif is both an ancient and a convergent feature of neuropeptides, with conservation, acquisition, or loss of this motif occurring in different branches of the animal kingdom.},

The pathway functions in most eukaryotes, archaea, and some eubacteria. Only recently has much of the functional and structural basis for this metabolism been reported. The biosynthetic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase reactions rely on key amino acids that are different but are situated in active sites that are similar throughout the family of initial condensation enzymes. Both bacterial and animal HMG-CoA reductases have been extensively studied and the contrasts between these proteins and their interactions with statin inhibitors defined. The conversion of mevalonic acid to isopentenyl 5-diphosphate involves three ATP-dependent phosphorylation reactions. While bacterial enzymes responsible for these three reactions share a common protein fold, animal enzymes differ in this respect as the recently reported structure of human phosphomevalonate kinase demonstrates. There are significant contrasts between observations on metabolite inhibition of mevalonate phosphorylation in bacteria and animals. The structural basis for these contrasts has also recently been reported. Alternatives to the phosphomevalonate kinase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase reactions may exist in archaea. Thus, new details regarding isopentenyl diphosphate synthesis from acetyl-CoA continue to emerge.},

According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection.

To what extent do protein interactions act as constraints during evolution of the protein sequence? How does the type of interaction, specifically transient or obligate, play into these constraints? Are the mutations in the binding site of an interacting protein correlated with mutations in the binding site of its partner? We address these and other questions by relying on a carefully curated dataset of protein complex structures. Results point to the importance of distinguishing between transient and obligate interactions. We conclude that residues in the interfaces of obligate complexes tend to evolve at a relatively slower rate, allowing them to coevolve with their interacting partners. In contrast, the plasticity inherent in transient interactions leads to an increased rate of substitution for the interface residues and leaves little or no evidence of correlated mutations across the interface.},

	abstract = {Progress in uncovering the protein interaction networks of several species has led to questions of what underlying principles might govern their organization. Few studies have tried to determine the impact of protein interaction network evolution on the observed physiological differences between species. Using comparative genomics and structural information, we show here that eukaryotic species have rewired their interactomes at a fast rate of approximately 10(-5) interactions changed per protein pair, per million years of divergence. For Homo sapiens this corresponds to 10(3) interactions changed per million years. Additionally we find that the specificity of binding strongly determines the interaction turnover and that different biological processes show significantly different link dynamics. In particular, human proteins involved in immune response, transport, and establishment of localization show signs of positive selection for change of interactions. Our analysis suggests that a small degree of molecular divergence can give rise to important changes at the network level. We propose that the power law distribution observed in protein interaction networks could be partly explained by the cell's requirement for different degrees of protein binding specificity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The melatonin receptor subfamily contains three members Mel1a, Mel1b and Mel1c, found in all vertebrates except for Mel1c which is found only in fish, Xenopus species and the chicken. Another receptor, the melatonin related receptor known as GPR50, found exclusively in mammals and later identified as a member of the melatonin receptor subfamily because of its identity to the three melatonin receptors despite its absence of affinity for melatonin. The aim of this study was to describe the evolutionary relationships between GPR50 and the three other members of the melatonin receptor subfamily.
RESULTS: Using an in silico approach, we demonstrated that GPR50 is the ortholog of the high affinity Mel1c receptor. It was necessary to also study the synteny of this gene to reach this conclusion because classical mathematical models that estimate orthology and build phylogenetic trees were not sufficient. The receptor has been deeply remodelled through evolution by the mutation of numerous amino acids and by the addition of a long C-terminal tail. These alterations have modified its affinity for melatonin and probably affected its interactions with the other two known melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 that are encoded by Mel1a and Mel1b genes respectively. Evolutionary studies provided evidence that the GPR50 group evolved under different selective pressure as compared to the orthologous groups Me11 a, b, and c.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that there are only three members in the melatonin receptor subfamily with one of them (Me11c) undergoing rapid evolution from fishes and birds to mammals. Further studies are necessary to investigate the physiological roles of this receptor.},

Each GPCR type distributes diversely in different evolutionary hierarchies of eukaryotes, but it has a distinctive boundary in the era of metazoan.

In the century following the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, hypotheses regarding the evolution of the major branches of the animal kingdom - their relationships to each other and the evolution of their body plans - was based on a consideration of the morphological and developmental characteristics of the different animal groups. This morphology-based approach had many successes but important aspects of the evolutionary tree remained disputed. In the past three decades, molecular data, most obviously primary sequences of DNA and proteins, have provided an estimate of animal phylogeny largely independent of the morphological evolution we would ultimately like to understand. The molecular tree that has evolved over the past three decades has drastically altered our view of animal phylogeny and many aspects of the tree are no longer contentious. The focus of molecular studies on relationships between animal groups means, however, that the discipline has become somewhat divorced from the underlying biology and from the morphological characteristics whose evolution we aim to understand. Here, we consider what we currently know of animal phylogeny; what aspects we are still uncertain about and what our improved understanding of animal phylogeny can tell us about the evolution of the great diversity of animal life.},

	abstract = {Allatostatin type A receptors (AST-ARs) are a group of G-protein coupled receptors activated by members of the FGL-amide (AST-A) peptide family that inhibit food intake and development in arthropods. Despite their physiological importance the evolution of the AST-A system is poorly described and relatively few receptors have been isolated and functionally characterised in insects. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the origin and comparative evolution of the AST-A system. To determine how evolution and feeding modified the function of AST-AR the duplicate receptors in Anopheles mosquitoes, were characterised. Phylogeny and gene synteny suggested that invertebrate AST-A receptors and peptide genes shared a common evolutionary origin with KISS/GAL receptors and ligands. AST-ARs and KISSR emerged from a common gene ancestor after the divergence of GALRs in the bilaterian genome. In arthropods, the AST-A system evolved through lineage-specific events and the maintenance of two receptors in the flies and mosquitoes (Diptera) was the result of a gene duplication event. Speciation of Anopheles mosquitoes affected receptor gene organisation and characterisation of AST-AR duplicates (GPRALS1 and 2) revealed that in common with other insects, the mosquito receptors were activated by insect AST-A peptides and the iCa2+-signalling pathway was stimulated. GPRALS1 and 2 were expressed mainly in mosquito midgut and ovaries and transcript abundance of both receptors was modified by feeding. A blood meal strongly up-regulated expression of both GPRALS in the midgut (p {\textless} 0.05) compared to glucose fed females. Based on the results we hypothesise that the AST-A system in insects shared a common origin with the vertebrate KISS system and may also share a common function as an integrator of metabolism and reproduction.
HIGHLIGHTS: AST-A and KISS/GAL receptors and ligands shared common ancestry prior to the protostome-deuterostome divergence. Phylogeny and gene synteny revealed that AST-AR and KISSR emerged after GALR gene divergence. AST-AR genes were present in the hemichordates but were lost from the chordates. In protostomes, AST-ARs persisted and evolved through lineage-specific events and duplicated in the arthropod radiation. Diptera acquired and maintained functionally divergent duplicate AST-AR genes.},

Herein, we present the first large-scale map of cell-to-cell communication between 144 human primary cell types. We reveal that most cells express tens to hundreds of ligands and receptors to create a highly connected signalling network through multiple ligand-receptor paths. We also observe extensive autocrine signalling with approximately two-thirds of partners possibly interacting on the same cell type. We find that plasma membrane and secreted proteins have the highest cell-type specificity, they are evolutionarily younger than intracellular proteins, and that most receptors had evolved before their ligands. We provide an online tool to interactively query and visualize our networks and demonstrate how this tool can reveal novel cell-to-cell interactions with the prediction that mast cells signal to monoblastic lineages via the CSF1-CSF1R interacting pair.},

A heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit was identified as a mammalian Galpha homologue, and a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which initiates the signaling pathway in response to glucose addition, was identified.

	abstract = {Cell differentiation requires different pathways to act in concert to produce a specialized cell type. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes filamentous growth in response to nutrient limitation. Differentiation to the filamentous cell type requires multiple signaling pathways, including a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To identify new regulators of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway, a genetic screen was performed with a collection of 4072 nonessential deletion mutants constructed in the filamentous (Σ1278b) strain background. The screen, in combination with directed gene-deletion analysis, uncovered 97 new regulators of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway comprising 40\% of the major regulators of filamentous growth. Functional classification extended known connections to the pathway and identified new connections. One function for the extensive regulatory network was to adjust the activity of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway to the activity of other pathways that regulate the response. In support of this idea, an unregulated filamentous growth MAPK pathway led to an uncoordinated response. Many of the pathways that regulate filamentous growth also regulated each other's targets, which brings to light an integrated signaling network that regulates the differentiation response. The regulatory network characterized here provides a template for understanding MAPK-dependent differentiation that may extend to other systems, including fungal pathogens and metazoans.},

	abstract = {Cells sense several kinds of stimuli and trigger corresponding responses through signaling pathways. As a result, cells must process and integrate multiple signals in parallel to maintain specificity and avoid erroneous cross-talk. In this study, we focus our theoretical effort on understanding specificity of a model network system in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which contains three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction cascades that share multiple signaling components. The cellular response to the pheromone, the filamentous growth and osmotic pressure stimuli in yeast is described and an integrative mathematical model for the three MAPK cascades is developed using available literature and experimental data. The theoretical framework for analyzing the specificity of signaling networks [Bardwell, L., Zou, X.F., Nie, Q., Komarova, N.L., 2007. Mathematical models of specificity in cell signaling. Biophys. J. 92, 3425-3441] is extended to include multiple interacting pathways with shared components. Simulations are also performed with any one stimulus, with any two simultaneous stimuli, and with the simultaneous application of the three stimuli. The interactions between the three pathways are systematically investigated. Moreover, the specificity and fidelity of this model system are calculated using our newly developed concept under different stimuli or with specific mutants. Our simulated and calculated results demonstrate that the yeast MAPK signaling network can achieve specificity and fidelity by filtering out spurious cross-talk between the relevant pathways through different mechanisms, such as scaffolding, cross-inhibiting, and feedback control. Proof that Pbs2 and Hog1 are essential for the maintenance of signaling specificity is presented. Our studies provide novel insights into integration of relevant signaling pathways in a biological system and the mechanisms conferring specificity in cellular signaling networks.},

Moreover, Ras signalling has been identified in several pathogenic yeasts as a key controller for virulence, due to its involvement in yeast morphogenesis.

NUMB (protein numb homologue), a key regulator of cell fate, represents an attractive, actionable target in prostate cancer. NUMB participates in the observed deregulation of NOTCH (neurogenic locus notch homologue protein) signalling in prostate tumours, and the NUMB–NOTCH interaction regulates cell fate.

These findings revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying MAPK functions in plant disease resistance. MAPK cascades have also emerged as battlegrounds of plant-pathogen interactions. Activation of MAPKs is one of the earliest signaling events after plant sensing of pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) and pathogen effectors. MAPK cascades are involved in signaling multiple defense responses, including the biosynthesis/signaling of plant stress/defense hormones, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, stomatal closure, defense gene activation, phytoalexin biosynthesis, cell wall strengthening, and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death. Pathogens, however, employ effectors to suppress plant MAPK activation and downstream defense responses to promote pathogenesis.},

However, these scenarios have been proposed individually and have never been studied in a global way. In this study, we investigated 30 mammalian pairs of ligand/receptor for which the first ligand appeared after its receptor in the tree of life, by using common indexes of selection, and proposed different scenarios explaining the earlier appearance of a receptor relative to its ligand. Based on 3D structural studies, our indexes allowed us to classify the evolution of these partners into different scenarios: 1) a scenario where the binding interface of the receptor is already present and under purifying selection before the appearance of the ligand; 2) a scenario where the binding interface seems to have appeared progressively, and 3) a scenario where the binding site seems to have been reshuffled since its appearance. As some scenarios were confirmed by the literature, we concluded that simple indexes can give a good highlight of the evolutive history of two partners that did not appear at the same time. Based on these scenarios, we also hypothesize that the replacement of a ligand by another is a frequent phenomenon during evolution.},

To confirm this hypothesis in vivo, we generated and characterized Drosophila VDAC (porin) mutants and found that Porin is not required for mitochondrial apoptosis, which is consistent with the previous mouse studies. We also reported a novel physiological role of Porin. Loss of porin resulted in locomotive defects and male sterility. Intriguingly, porin mutants exhibited elongated mitochondria in indirect flight muscle, whereas Porin overexpression produced fragmented mitochondria. Through genetic analysis with the components of mitochondrial fission and fusion, we found that the elongated mitochondria phenotype in porin mutants were suppressed by increased mitochondrial fission, but enhanced by increased mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial fission by Drp1 expression suppressed the flight defects in the porin mutants. Collectively, our study showed that loss of Drosophila Porin results in mitochondrial morphological defects and suggested that the defective mitochondrial function by Porin deficiency affects the mitochondrial remodeling process.},

	abstract = {Expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax under the control of a GAL10 promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in galactose-inducible cell death. Immunofluorescence studies suggested that Bax is principally associated with mitochondria in yeast cells. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain from Bax [creating Bax (deltaTM)] prevented targeting to mitochondrial and completely abolished cytotoxic function in yeast cells, suggesting that membrane targeting is crucial for Bax-mediated lethality. Fusing a TM domain from Mas70p, a yeast mitochondrial outer membrane protein, to Bax (deltaTM) restored targeting to mitochondria and cytotoxic function in yeast cells. Deletion of four well-conserved amino acids (IGDE) from the BH3 domain of Bax ablated its ability to homodimerize and completely abrogated lethality in yeast cells. In contrast, several Bax mutants which retained ability to homodimerize (deltaBH1, deltaBH2, and delta1-58) also retained at least partial lethal function in yeast cells. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, expression of the wild-type Bax protein in Rat-1 fibroblasts and 293 epithelial cells induced apoptosis, whereas the Bax (deltaIGDE) mutant failed to induce apoptosis and did not associate with endogenous wild-type Bax protein. In contrast to yeast cells, Bax (deltaTM) protein retained cytotoxic function in Rat-1 and 293 cells, was targeted largely to mitochondria, and dimerized with endogenous Bax in mammalian cells. Thus, the dimerization-mediating BH3 domain and targeting to mitochondrial membranes appear to be essential for the cytotoxic function of Bax in both yeast and mammalian cells.},

Signaling is turned on and off by regulating stability of the effector β-catenin (β-cat). The multiprotein destruction complex binds and phosphorylates β-cat and transfers it to the SCF-TrCP E3-ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination and destruction. Wnt signals act though Dishevelled to turn down the destruction complex, stabilizing β-cat. Recent work clarified underlying mechanisms, but important questions remain. We explore β-cat transfer from the destruction complex to the E3 ligase, and test models suggesting Dishevelled and APC2 compete for association with Axin. We find that Slimb/TrCP is a dynamic component of the destruction complex biomolecular condensate, while other E3 proteins are not. Recruitment requires Axin and not APC, and Axin's RGS domain plays an important role. We find that elevating Dishevelled levels in Drosophila embryos has paradoxical effects, promoting the ability of limiting levels of Axin to turn off Wnt signaling. When we elevate Dishevelled levels, it forms its own cytoplasmic puncta, but these do not recruit Axin. Superresolution imaging in mammalian cells raises the possibility that this may result by promoting Dishevelled:Dishevelled interactions at the expense of Dishevelled: Axin interactions when Dishevelled levels are high.},

In the present work, we have generated mice with specific invalidation of Mdm2 and Mdm4 genes in the mouse oocyte (Mdm2Ocko and Mdm4Ocko mice), to test their implication in survival of these germ cells. Most of the Mdm2Ocko but not Mdm4Ocko mice were sterile, with a dramatic reduction of the weight of ovaries and genital tract, a strong increase in follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone serum levels, and a reduction of anti-mullerian hormone serum levels. Histological analyses revealed an obvious decrease of the number of growing follicles beyond the primary stage in Mdm2Ocko ovaries in comparison to controls, with a pronounced increase in the apparition of primary atretic follicles, most being devoid of oocyte. Similar phenotypes were observed with Mdm2OckoMdm4Ocko ovaries, with no worsening of the phenotype. However, we failed to detect any increase in p53 level in mutant oocytes, nor any other apoptotic marker, introgression of this targeted invalidation in p53−/− mice restored the fertility of females. This study is the first to show that Mdm2, but not Mdm4, has a critical role in oocyte survival and would be involved in premature ovarian insufficiency phenotype.},

Deletion of the PPR renders p53 more sensitive to inhibition by Mdm2 via an unknown mechanism. We have explored the mechanism by which the PPR modulates the p53/Mdm2 loop. Proline 82 of p53 was identified to be essential for its interaction with the checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) and consequent phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20, following DNA damage. These physical and functional interactions are regulated by Pin1 through cis-trans isomerization of proline 82. Our study unravels the pathway by which Pin1 activates p53 in response to DNA damage and explains how Pin1 protects p53 from Mdm2. Further, we propose a role for Pin1-dependent induction of p53 conformational change as a mechanism responsible for the enhanced interaction between p53 and Chk2 following DNA damage. Importantly, our findings elucidate the selection for mutations in the Pin1 target Thr81/Pro82 motif within the PPR of p53 in human cancer.},

	abstract = {The BGLF4 protein kinase of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the conserved family of herpesvirus protein kinases which, to some extent, have a function similar to that of the cellular cyclin-dependent kinase in regulating multiple cellular and viral substrates. In a yeast two-hybrid screening assay, a splicing variant of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was found to interact with the BGLF4 protein. This interaction was defined further by coimmunoprecipitation in transfected cells and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down in vitro. Using reporter assays, we show that BGLF4 effectively suppresses the activities of the poly(I:C)-stimulated IFN-beta promoter and IRF3-responsive element. Moreover, BGLF4 represses the poly(I:C)-stimulated expression of endogenous IFN-beta mRNA and the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701. In searching for a possible mechanism, BGLF4 was shown not to affect the dimerization, nuclear translocation, or CBP recruitment of IRF3 upon poly(I:C) treatment. Notably, BGLF4 reduces the amount of active IRF3 recruited to the IRF3-responsive element containing the IFN-beta promoter region in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. BGLF4 phosphorylates GST-IRF3 in vitro, but Ser339-Pro340 phosphorylation-dependent, Pin1-mediated downregulation is not responsible for the repression. Most importantly, we found that three proline-dependent phosphorylation sites at Ser123, Ser173, and Thr180, which cluster in a region between the DNA binding and IRF association domains of IRF3, contribute additively to the BGLF4-mediated repression of IRF3(5D) transactivation activity. IRF3 signaling is activated in reactivated EBV-positive NA cells, and the knockdown of BGLF4 further stimulates IRF3-responsive reporter activity. The data presented here thus suggest a novel mechanism by which herpesviral protein kinases suppress host innate immune responses and facilitate virus replication.},

However, many relevant tools consider a limited number of pathway sources, missing out on many genes and gene-to-gene connections. Simply pooling several pathways sources would result in redundancy and the lack of systematic pathway interrelations. To address this, we exercised a combination of hierarchical clustering and nearest neighbor graph representation, with judiciously selected cutoff values, thereby consolidating 3215 human pathways from 12 sources into a set of 1073 SuperPaths. Our unification algorithm finds a balance between reducing redundancy and optimizing the level of pathway-related informativeness for individual genes. We show a substantial enhancement of the SuperPaths’ capacity to infer gene-to-gene relationships when compared with individual pathway sources, separately or taken together. Further, we demonstrate that the chosen 12 sources entail nearly exhaustive gene coverage. The computed SuperPaths are presented in a new online database, PathCards, showing each SuperPath, its constituent network of pathways, and its contained genes.

	abstract = {The Mdm2 proto-oncogene was originally identified as one of several genes contained on a mouse double minute chromosome present in a transformed derivative of 3T3 cells. Overexpression of Mdm2 can immortalize primary cultures of rodent fibroblasts. Human MDM2 is amplified in 30-40\% of sarcomas, and is overexpressed in leukaemic cells. The Mdm2 oncoprotein forms a complex with the p53 tumour-suppressor protein and inhibits p53-mediated transregulation of gene expression. Because Mdm2 expression increases in response to p53, Mdm2-p53 binding may autoregulate Mdm2 expression and modulate the activity of p53 in the cell. We have created Mdm2-null and Mdm2/p53-null mice to determine whether Mdm2 possesses developmental functions in addition to the ability to complex with p53, and to investigate the biological role of Mdm2-p53 complex formation in development. Mice deficient for Mdm2 die early in development. In contrast, mice deficient for both Mdm2 and p53 develop normally and are viable. These results suggest that a critical role of Mdm2 in development is the regulation of p53 function.},

	abstract = {From the present review integrating old and new data emerge a few principles of gene expression in eukaryotes, and an infinite variety of possible mechanistic details generating the overal pattern. The few principles, most of which are not fundamentally new, may thus be summarized. 1) The eukaryotic genome is subdivided into transcriptional units: into transcriptons which are subject to individual activation controlled at DNA level. 2) Viral genomes may contain one or a few transcriptons, while cells of multicellular organisms contain from 3 x 10(3) in diptera up to an estimated 2 x 10(5) in birds and mammals. 3) Transcriptons may include one or several coding sequences. 4) Transcriptons vary considerably in size: in mammals and birds their size spectrum falls into the 2,000 to 20,000 bp range. 5) Units of coding information constituting one message (genes) and, possibly, units of regulative information are frequently broken up and stored within the transcripton in sub-genic blocks (of so far unknown significance) in general located at a certain distance from the 5' and 3' transcript terminals which are determined by the promotor and terminator signals. 6) The gene, in its specific definition as the functional unit underlying the phenotype, is in general constituted posttranscriptionally by the processing mechanisms from the mosaic of its genomic subunits in the transcripton; segments of coding, service and regulative sequences are recombined within themselves and with each other, polygenic transcripts separate into their unit messages. 7) Activated transcriptons produce pre-mRNA; these primary transcripts are colinear with the DNA of the transcriptional unit. 8) Primary pre-mRNA is processed into secondary pre-mRNA's by extragenic cleavage and intragenic ("splicing") processing, giving rise stepwise to functional mRNA. During this process chemical modifications as methylation, 5'-terminal capping and 3'-terminal polyadenylation take place. 9) Translation yields either potentially functional polypeptides or polycistronic polyproteins subject to further processing. 10) Processing is a regulated process; it involves many of the possible phases and mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation (cf. 39, 40).},

	abstract = {In many eukaryotes, including mammals, plants, yeast, and insects, introns can increase gene expression without functioning as a binding site for transcription factors. This phenomenon was termed 'intron-mediated enhancement'. Introns can increase transcript levels by affecting the rate of transcription, nuclear export, and transcript stability. Moreover, introns can also increase the efficiency of mRNA translation. This review discusses the current knowledge about these processes. The role of splicing in IME and the significance of intron position relative to the sites of transcription and translation initiation are elaborated. Particular emphasis is placed on the question why different introns, present at the same location of the same genes and spliced at a similar high efficiency, can have very different impacts on expression - from almost no effect to considerable stimulation. This situation can be at least partly accounted for by the identification of splicing-unrelated intronic elements with a special ability to enhance mRNA accumulation or translational efficiency. The many factors that could lead to the large variation observed between the impact of introns in different genes and experimental systems are highlighted. It is suggested that there is no sole, definite answer to the question "how do introns enhance gene expression". Rather, each intron-gene combination might undergo its own unique mixture of processes that lead to the perceptible outcome.},

However, because predicting orthology is computationally intensive at large scale, and most pipelines are relatively inaccessible (e.g., new assignments only available through database updates), less precise homology-based functional transfer is still the default for (meta-)genome annotation. We, therefore, developed eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional annotation of large sets of sequences based on fast orthology assignments using precomputed clusters and phylogenies from the eggNOG database. To validate our method, we benchmarked Gene Ontology (GO) predictions against two widely used homology-based approaches: BLAST and InterProScan. Orthology filters applied to BLAST results reduced the rate of false positive assignments by 11\%, and increased the ratio of experimentally validated terms recovered over all terms assigned per protein by 15\%. Compared with InterProScan, eggNOG-mapper achieved similar proteome coverage and precision while predicting, on average, 41 more terms per protein and increasing the rate of experimentally validated terms recovered over total term assignments per protein by 35\%. EggNOG-mapper predictions scored within the top-5 methods in the three GO categories using the CAFA2 NK-partial benchmark. Finally, we evaluated eggNOG-mapper for functional annotation of metagenomics data, yielding better performance than interProScan. eggNOG-mapper runs ∼15× faster than BLAST and at least 2.5× faster than InterProScan.

	abstract = {Fishes possess more genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinases from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family than other organisms. Three of the four genes present in higher vertebrates have been duplicated early during the evolution of the ray-finned fish lineage possibly as a consequence of an event of whole genome duplication. In the fish Xiphophorus, a much more recent local event of gene duplication of the egfr co-orthologue egfr-b generated a eighth gene, the Xmrk oncogene. This duplicate acquired within a short time a constitutive activity and a pigment cell-specific overexpression responsible for the induction of melanoma in certain interspecific hybrids. Despite its frequent loss during evolution of the genus Xiphophorus, the maintenance of Xmrk in numerous species and its evolution under purifying selection suggest a so far unknown function under certain natural conditions. One of the known functions of Xmrk in tumor cells is the suppression of differentiation of melanocytes induced by the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF. While only one gene with alternative 5' exons and promoters is present in higher vertebrates, two mitf genes were identified in fish. Subfunctionalization of mitf paralogues by differential degeneration of alternative exons and regulatory sequences led particularly to the formation of a mitf gene specifically expressed in the melanocyte lineage. These observations validate fish as an outstanding model to study the mechanisms and biological consequences of gene and genome duplication but underline the complexity of the fish model and the caution necessary in transferring knowledge from fish to higher vertebrates and vice versa.},

A re-examination of the connectivity of essential genes in yeast and humans indicated that the available data do not support the presumption that the number of interaction partners can accurately predict whether a gene is essential. Finally, we found that proteins encoded by genes mutated in inherited genetic disorders are likely to interact with proteins known to cause similar disorders, suggesting the existence of disease subnetworks.

While radioreceptor assays are fast, easy to use and reproducible, their major disadvantage is that they are hazardous to human health, produce radioactive waste, require special laboratory conditions and are thus rather expensive on a large scale. This has led to the development of non-radioactive assays based on optical methods like fluorescence polarization, fluorescence resonance energy transfer or surface plasmon resonance. In light of their application in high-throughput screening environments, there has been an emphasis on so called "mix-and-measure" assays that do not require separation of bound from free ligand. The advent of recombinant production of receptors has contributed to the increased availability of specific assays and some aspects of the expression of recombinant receptors will be reviewed.

SCOPE OF REVIEW: Insulin and insulin receptors are the focus of other chapters in this series and will therefore not be discussed further. Here we review the basic components of the IGF system, their role in normal physiology and in critical pathology's. While this review concentrates on the role of IGFs in human physiology, animal models have been essential in providing understanding of the IGF system, and its regulation, and are briefly described.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: IGF-I has effects via the circulation and locally within tissues to regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and survival, thereby controlling overall body growth. IGF-II levels are highest prenatally when it has important effects on growth. In adults, IGF-II plays important tissue-specific roles, including the maintenance of stem cell populations. Although the IGF-IR is closely related to the IR it has distinct physiological roles both on the cell surface and in the nucleus. The M6P/IGF-IIR, in contrast, is distinct and acts as a scavenger by mediating internalization and degradation of IGF-II. The IGFBPs bind IGF-I and IGF-II in the circulation to prolong their half-lives and modulate tissue access, thereby controlling IGF function. IGFBPs also have IGF ligand-independent cell effects.},

Of particular interest is the effect of the fish-specific whole genome duplication (FSGD) on the ligand-receptor system, as it has supplied this largest group of vertebrates with additional opportunities for sub- and/or neofunctionalization in this signaling system.
RESULTS: We identified the predicted components of the Egf receptor-ligand signaling system in teleost fishes (medaka, platyfish, stickleback, pufferfishes and zebrafish). We found two duplicated egfr genes, egfra and egfrb, in all available teleost genomes. Surprisingly only one copy for each of the seven Egfr ligands could be identified in most fishes, with zebrafish hbegf being the only exception. Special focus was put on medaka, for which we more closely investigated all Egf receptors and Egfr ligands. The different expression patterns of egfra, egfrb and their ligands in medaka tissues and embryo stages suggest differences in role and function. Preferential co-expression of different subsets of Egfr ligands corroborates the possible subfunctionalization and specialization of the two receptors in adult tissues. Bioinformatic analyses of the ligand-receptor interface between Egfr and its ligands show a very weak evolutionary conservation within this region. Using in vitro analyses of medaka Egfra, we could show that this receptor is only activated by medaka ligands, but not by human EGF. Altogether, our data suggest a lineage-specific Egfr/Egfr ligand co-evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that medaka Egfr signaling occurs via its two copies, Egfra and Egfrb, each of them being preferentially coexpressed with different subsets of Egfr ligands. This fish-specific occurrence of Egf receptor specialization offers unique opportunities to study the functions of different Egf receptor-ligand combinations and their biological outputs in vertebrates. Furthermore, our results strongly support the use of homologous ligands in future studies, as sufficient cross-specificity is very unlikely for this ligand/receptor system.},

	abstract = {Background: Proteins evolve at disparate rates, as a result of the action of different types and strengths of evolutionary forces. An open question in evolutionary biology is what factors are responsible for this variability. In general, proteins whose function has a great impact on organisms’ fitness are expected to evolve under stronger selective pressures. In biosynthetic pathways, upstream genes usually evolve under higher levels of selective constraint than those acting at the downstream part, as a result of their higher hierarchical position. Similar observations have been made in transcriptional regulatory networks, whose upstream elements appear to be more essential and subject to selection. Less well understood is, however, how selective pressures distribute along signal transduction pathways.
Results: Here, I combine comparative genomics and directed protein interaction data to study the distribution of evolutionary forces across the human signal transduction network. Surprisingly, no evidence was found for higher levels of selective constraint at the upstream network genes (those occupying more hierarchical positions). On the contrary, purifying selection was found to act more strongly on genes acting at the downstream part of the network, which seems to be due to downstream genes being more highly and broadly expressed, performing certain functions and, in particular, encoding proteins that are more highly connected in the protein–protein interaction network. When the effect of these confounding factors is discounted, upstream and downstream genes evolve at similar rates. The trends found in the overall signaling network are exemplified by analysis of the distribution of purifying selection along the mammalian Ras signaling pathway, showing that upstream and downstream genes evolve at similar rates.
Conclusions: These results indicate that the upstream/downstream position of proteins in the signal transduction network has, in general, no direct effect on their rates of evolution, suggesting that upstream and downstream genes are similarly important for the function of the network. This implies that natural selection differently distributes across signal transduction networks and across biosynthetic and transcriptional regulatory networks, which might reflect fundamental differences in their function and organization.},

	abstract = {Whereas the rate of gene duplication is relatively high, only certain duplications survive the filter of natural selection and can contribute to genome evolution. However, the reasons why certain genes can be retained after duplication whereas others cannot remain largely unknown. Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), whose structures fluctuate between alternative conformational states. Due to their high flexibility, IDRs often enable protein–protein interactions and are the target of post-translational modifications. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have characteristics that might either stimulate or hamper the retention of their encoding genes after duplication. On the one hand, IDRs may enable functional diversification, thus promoting duplicate retention. On the other hand, increased IDP availability is expected to result in deleterious unspecific interactions. Here, we interrogate the proteomes of human, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and Escherichia coli, in order to ascertain the impact of protein intrinsic disorder on gene duplicability. We show that, in general, proteins encoded by duplicated genes tend to be less disordered than those encoded by singletons. The only exception is proteins encoded by ohnologs, which tend to be more disordered than those encoded by singletons or genes resulting from small-scale duplications. Our results indicate that duplication of genes encoding IDPs outside the context of whole-genome duplication (WGD) is often deleterious, but that IDRs facilitate retention of duplicates in the context of WGD. We discuss the potential evolutionary implications of our results.},

	abstract = {Gene duplication is an important mechanism for acquiring new genes and creating genetic novelty in organisms. Many new gene functions have evolved through gene duplication and it has contributed tremendously to the evolution of developmental programmes in various organisms. Gene duplication can result from unequal crossing over, retroposition or chromosomal (or genome) duplication. Understanding the mechanisms that generate duplicate gene copies and the subsequent dynamics among gene duplicates is vital because these investigations shed light on localized and genomewide aspects of evolutionary forces shaping intra-specific and inter-specific genome contents, evolutionary relationships, and interactions. Based on whole-genome analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, there is compelling evidence that angiosperms underwent two whole-genome duplication events early during their evolutionary history. Recent studies have shown that these events were crucial for creation of many important developmental and regulatory genes found in extant angiosperm genomes. Recent studies also provide strong indications that even yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with its compact genome, is in fact an ancient tetraploid. Gene duplication can provide new genetic material for mutation, drift and selection to act upon, the result of which is specialized or new gene functions. Without gene duplication the plasticity of a genome or species in adapting to changing environments would be severely limited. Whether a duplicate is retained depends upon its function, its mode of duplication, (i.e. whether it was duplicated during a whole-genome duplication event), the species in which it occurs, and its expression rate. The exaptation of preexisting secondary functions is an important feature in gene evolution, just as it is in morphological evolution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a phenotype that is characterized by the inability of a cell to effectively repair DNA double-strand breaks using the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. Loss-of-function genes involved in this pathway can sensitize tumors to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy, which target the destruction of cancer cells by working in concert with HRD through synthetic lethality. However, to identify patients with these tumors, it is vital to understand how to best measure homologous repair (HR) status and to characterize the level of alignment in these measurements across different diagnostic platforms. A key current challenge is that there is no standardized method to define, measure, and report HR status using diagnostics in the clinical setting.
METHODS: Friends of Cancer Research convened a consortium of project partners from key healthcare sectors to address concerns about the lack of consistency in the way HRD is defined and methods for measuring HR status.
RESULTS: This publication provides findings from the group's discussions that identified opportunities to align the definition of HRD and the parameters that contribute to the determination of HR status. The consortium proposed recommendations and best practices to benefit the broader cancer community.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this publication provides additional perspectives for scientist, physician, laboratory, and patient communities to contextualize the definition of HRD and various platforms that are used to measure HRD in tumors.},

These events lead to genome rearrangements associated with a wide array of diseases.Accumulating evidence suggests that NAHR in the germ line shares mechanistic similarities with allelic recombination during meiosis, consistent with the hypothesis that both are initiated by the same type of programmed DSBs.The spatial organization of repeated sequences in a nucleus might influence the frequency of meiotic NAHR.Meiotic NAHR between natural repetitive elements occurs at low levels, at least in yeast, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that suppress NAHR.Suppression of meiotic DSBs in repetitive elements might be one of the conserved cellular strategies for preventing NAHR.Recombination-dependent homologue pairing might favour allelic recombination over NAHR by bringing allelic sequences in closer proximity.In many organisms, crossover formation is suppressed between divergent sequences.},

In particular, we compared whole-genome duplication (WGD) with small-scale duplication (SSD), as well as tissue restricted with ubiquitously expressed genes. All patterns were also analysed in the light of gene evolutionary rates. Among those genes characterized by rapid evolution and expressed in a restricted range of tissues, SSD was represented in a larger proportion than WGD. Conversely, genes with ubiquitous expression were associated with slower evolutionary rates and a larger proportion of WGD. The results also show that evolutionary rates were faster in genes expressed in endodermal tissues and slower in ectodermal genes. Accordingly, the proportion of the SSD and WGD genes was highest in the endoderm and ectoderm, respectively. Therefore, quickly evolving SSD genes might have contributed to the faster evolution of endodermal tissues, whereas the comparatively slowly evolving WGD genes might have functioned to maintain the basic characteristics of ectodermal tissues. Mesenchymal tissues occupied an intermediate position in this regard, whereas the patterns observed for haemocytes were unique. Rapid tissue evolution could be related to a specific gene duplication mode (SSD) and faster molecular evolution in response to exposure to the external environment. These findings reveal general patterns underlying the evolution of tissues and their corresponding genes.},

This review examines how a growing knowledge of the vast range of animal–bacterial interactions, whether in shared ecosystems or intimate symbioses, is fundamentally altering our understanding of animal biology. Specifically, we highlight recent technological and intellectual advances that have changed our thinking about five questions: how have bacteria facilitated the origin and evolution of animals; how do animals and bacteria affect each other’s genomes; how does normal animal development depend on bacterial partners; how is homeostasis maintained between animals and their symbionts; and how can ecological approaches deepen our understanding of the multiple levels of animal–bacterial interaction. As answers to these fundamental questions emerge, all biologists will be challenged to broaden their appreciation of these interactions and to include investigations of the relationships between and among bacteria and their animal partners as we seek a better understanding of the natural world.},

The majority of these appear to be nonessential genes (i.e., are not embryonically lethal when inactivated), and one could therefore speculate that they are late additions in the evolutionary lineage toward humans. Contrary to this expectation, we find that they are in fact significantly overrepresented among the genes that have emerged during the early evolution of the metazoa. Using a phylostratigraphic approach, we have studied the evolutionary emergence of such genes at 19 phylogenetic levels. The majority of disease genes was already present in the eukaryotic ancestor, and the second largest number has arisen around the time of evolution of multicellularity. Conversely, genes specific to the mammalian lineage are highly underrepresented. Hence, genes involved in genetic diseases are not simply a random subset of all genes in the genome but are biased toward ancient genes.},

In contrast, differences among genomes have received less attention. Yet these can be expected to govern the physiological and morphological distinctions apparent among species, especially if such differences are the result of evolutionary adaptation. A recent comparison of the draft sequences of mouse and human genomes has shed light on the selective forces that have predominated in their recent evolutionary histories. In particular, mouse-specific clusters of homologues associated with roles in reproduction, immunity and host defence appear to be under diversifying positive selective pressure, as indicated by high ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates. These clusters are also frequently punctuated by homologous pseudogenes. They thus have experienced numerous gene death, as well as gene birth, events. These regions appear, therefore, to have borne the brunt of adaptive evolution that underlies physiological and behavioural innovation in mice. We predict that the availability of numerous animal genomes will give rise to a new field of genome zoology in which differences in animal physiology and ethology are illuminated by the study of genomic sequence variations.},

Until recently, it was believed that an unmodified oxytocin sequence was present in all placental mammals. This study analyzed oxytocin (OXT) in 29 primate species and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) in 21 of these species. We report here three novel OXT forms in the New World monkeys, as well as a more extensive distribution of a previously described variant (Leu8Pro). In structural terms, these OXTs share the same three low-energy conformations in solution during molecular dynamic simulations, with subtle differences in their side chains. A consistent signal of positive selection was detected in the Cebidae family, and OXT position 8 showed a statistically significant (P = 0.013) correlation with litter size. Several OXTR changes were identified, some of them promoting gain or loss of putative phosphorylation sites, with possible consequences for receptor internalization and desensitization. OXTR amino acid sites are under positive selection, and intramolecular and intermolecular coevolutionary processes with OXT were also detected. We suggest that some New World monkey OXT-OXTR forms can be correlated to male parental care through the increase of cross-reactivity with its correlated vasopressin system.},

Thompson demonstrates how an integrated study of life histories, genetics, and the geographic structure of populations yields a broader understanding of coevolution, or the development of reciprocal adaptations and specializations in interdependent species.Using examples of species interactions from an enormous range of taxa, Thompson examines how and when extreme specialization evolves in interdependent species and how geographic differences in specialization, adaptation, and the outcomes of interactions shape coevolution. Through the geographic mosaic theory, Thompson bridges the gap between the study of specialization and coevolution in local communities and the study of broader patterns seen in comparisons of the phylogenies of interacting species.},

The gene repertoire has recently been mined in great detail in several species including mouse, rat, dog, chicken and the early vertebrate Branchiostoma (Branchiostoma floridae) and one of the most primitive animals, the cniderian Nematostella (Nematostella vectensis). There is a one-to-one relationship of the rodent (mouse and rat) and human orthologues with the exception the EMR2 and EMR3 that do not seem to have orthologues in either rat or mouse. All 33 human Adhesion GPCR genes are present in the dog genome but the dog genome also contains 5 additional full-length Adhesion genes. The dog and human Adhesion orthologues have higher average protein sequence identity than the rodent (rat and mouse) and the human sequences. The Adhesion family is well-represented in chicken with 21 one-to-one orthologous with humans, while 12 human Adhesion GPCRs lack a chicken ortholog. Branchiostoma has rich repertoire of Adhesion GPCRs with at least 37 genes. Moreover, the Adhesion GPCRs in Branchiostoma have several novel domains their N-termini, like Somatomedin B, Kringle, Lectin C-type, SRCR, LDLa, Immunoglobulin I-set, CUB and TNFR. Nematostella has also Adhesion GPCRs that are show domain structure and sequence similarities in the transmembrane regions with different classes of mammalian GPCRs. The Nematostella genome has a unique set of Adhesion-like sequences lacking GPS domains. There is considerable evidence showing that the Adhesion family is ancestral to the peptide hormone binding Secretin family of GPCRs.},

	abstract = {Evolution of eukaryotic species and their genomes has been traditionally understood as a vertical process in which genetic material is transmitted from parents to offspring along a lineage, and in which genetic exchange is restricted within species boundaries. However, mounting evidence from comparative genomics indicates that this paradigm is often violated. Horizontal gene transfer and mating between diverged lineages blur species boundaries and challenge the reconstruction of evolutionary histories of species and their genomes. Nonvertical evolution might be more restricted in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, yet it is not negligible and can be common in certain groups. Recognition of such processes brings about the need to incorporate this complexity into our models, as well as to conceptually reframe eukaryotic diversity and evolution. Here, I review the recent work from genomics studies that supports the effects of nonvertical modes of evolution including introgression, hybridization, and horizontal gene transfer in different eukaryotic groups. I then discuss emerging patterns and effects, illustrated by specific examples, that support the conclusion that nonvertical processes are often at the root of important evolutionary transitions and adaptations. I will argue that a paradigm shift is needed to naturally accommodate nonvertical processes in eukaryotic evolution.},

Observations that orthologues show almost no variation across vertebrates yet differ by two amino acids between humans and chimpanzees have led to speculation that recent evolutionary changes might relate to the emergence of language. Echolocating bats face especially challenging sensorimotor demands, using vocal signals for orientation and often for prey capture. To determine whether mutations in the FoxP2 gene could be associated with echolocation, we sequenced FoxP2 from echolocating and non-echolocating bats as well as a range of other mammal species. We found that contrary to previous reports, FoxP2 is not highly conserved across all nonhuman mammals but is extremely diverse in echolocating bats. We detected divergent selection (a change in selective pressure) at FoxP2 between bats with contrasting sonar systems, suggesting the intriguing possibility of a role for FoxP2 in the evolution and development of echolocation. We speculate that observed accelerated evolution of FoxP2 in bats supports a previously proposed function in sensorimotor coordination.},

This suggests an important role for FoxP2 in vertebrate brains, regardless of whether they support imitative vocal learning or not. Its expression pattern pinpoints neural circuits that might have been crucial for the evolution of speech and language, including the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Recent studies in songbirds show that during times of song plasticity FoxP2 is upregulated in a striatal region essential for song learning.

To determine whether FoxP2 plays a similar role in song-learning birds, we sequenced exon 7 of FoxP2 in multiple song-learning and nonlearning birds.

The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino-acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.},

For the last several decades, researchers have used increasingly large and robust phylogenies to study the evolutionary history of individual clades and to investigate the causes of the glaring disparities in diversity among groups. Whereas typically not the focal point of individual clade-level studies, many researchers have remarked on recurrent patterns that have been observed across many different groups and at many different time scales. Whereas previous studies have documented various such regularities in topology and branch length distributions, they have typically focused on a single pattern and used a disparate collection (oftentimes, of quite variable reliability) of trees to assess it. Here we take advantage of modern megaphylogenies and unify previous disparate observations about the shapes embedded in the Tree of Life to create a catalog of the “major features of macroevolution.” By characterizing such a large swath of subtrees in a consistent way, we hope to provide a set of phenomena that process-based macroevolutionary models of diversification ought to seek to explain.

Even in one and the same race there are certain variations.The sugar corns have generally a larger number and the starch corns smaller; and there seem to exist certain connections between those two kinds of numbers of gemini, and it is likely that the smaller numbers were reduced from 12 and consequently the number 12 is original for all the races of Zea Mays.The size and shape of gemini are tolerably different as shown in the side view of the metaphase, and there are two sets of them, that is, each sort of gemini is duplicated. In the equatorial plate of the homotype division some pairs of chromosomes come in contact with each other or even fuse up altogether.Those two facts, chiefly the former, lead to the view that Zea Mays is probably a tetraploidal plant, not necessarily apogamic.It is suggested that the production of innumerable races of Zea Mays has a certain relation with the duplication of chromosomes, resulting in the double number derived from an original form which had probably 6 chromosomes in reduced number.An abnormal case was found in a race 'Amber rice pop corn.' The geminial chromosomes, though not all, separate from each other without intervention of the traction fibres, and the individual separated member divides again transversely. The homotype division is mostly skipped and the resting nuclei are directly formed. Sometimes few chromosomes are left in cytoplasm and dwarf nuclei are formed.},

Some of these features depend on developmental processes or cellular behaviours that are again unique to vertebrates. We are interested in the genetic changes that may have permitted the origin of these innovations. Gene duplication, followed by functional divergence of new genes, may be one class of mutation that permits major evolutionary change. Here we examine the hypothesis that gene duplication events occurred close to the origin and early radiation of the vertebrates. Genome size comparisons are compatible with the occurrence of duplications close to vertebrate origins; more precise insight comes from cloning and phylogenetic analysis of gene families from amphioxus, tunicates and vertebrates. Comparisons of Hox gene clusters, other homeobox gene families, Wnt genes and insulin-related genes all indicate that there was a major phase of gene duplication close to vertebrate origins, after divergence from the amphioxus lineage; we suggest there was probably a second phase of duplication close to jawed vertebrate origins. From amphioxus and vertebrate homeobox gene expression patterns, we suggest that there are multiple routes by which new genes arising from gene duplication acquire new functions and permit the evolution of developmental innovations.},

The tetraploid status of this species is corroborated here by in situ PCR and Southern blot analysis of a single-copy gene. The species meiotic configuration strongly suggests a hybrid derivation. To investigate the origin of T. barrerae further, the recently described Pipanacoctomys aureus was studied. This 92-chromosome species also has a duplicated genome size, redundant gene copy number and diploid-like meiotic pairing, consistent with an event of allotetraploidization. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial sequences indicates sister-group relationships between these two tetraploid rodents. The new karyotypic data and the phylogenetic relationships suggest the participation of the ancestral lineages of Octomys mimax in the genesis of P. aureus. The high overall DNA similarity and shared band homology revealed by genomic Southern hybridization as well as matching chromosome numbers between O. mimax and the descendant tetraploid species support the notion of introgressive hybridization between these taxa. © 2004 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2004, 82, 443–451.},

Despite rapid advances in genetics, including sequencing of the complete genomes of several divergent species, this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously and is still a matter of debate. If polyploidizations occurred during chordate evolution, there should be a network of paralogous regions in the present-day jawed vertebrate (Gnathostomata) genomes. Here we present an investigation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) paralogous regions, which we accomplished by characterizing the corresponding region in amphioxus by identifying nine anchor genes and sequencing both the anchor genes and the regions that flank them (a total of 400 kb). Phylogenetic analysis of 31 genes (including the anchor genes) in these regions shows that duplications occurred after the divergence of cephalochordates and vertebrates but before the Gnathostomata radiation. The distribution of human and amphioxus orthologs in their respective genomes and the relationship between these distributions support the en bloc duplication events. Our analysis represents the first step towards demonstrating that the human ancestral genome has undergone polyploidization. Moreover, reconstruction of the pre-duplicated region indicates that one of the duplicated regions retains the ancestral organization.},

	abstract = {Diploid and stable karyotypes are associated with health and fitness in animals. By contrast, whole-genome duplications—doublings of the entire complement of chromosomes—are linked to genetic instability and frequently found in human cancers1–3. It has been established that whole-genome duplications fuel chromosome instability through abnormal mitosis4–8; however, the immediate consequences of tetraploidy in the first interphase are not known. This is a key question because single whole-genome duplication events such as cytokinesis failure can promote tumorigenesis9 and DNA double-strand breaks10. Here we find that human cells undergo high rates of DNA damage during DNA replication in the first S phase following induction of tetraploidy. Using DNA combing and single-cell sequencing, we show that DNA replication dynamics is perturbed, generating under- and over-replicated regions. Mechanistically, we find that these defects result from a shortage of proteins during the G1/S transition, which impairs the fidelity of DNA replication. This work shows that within a single interphase, unscheduled tetraploid cells can acquire highly abnormal karyotypes. These findings provide an explanation for the genetic instability landscape that favours tumorigenesis after tetraploidization.},

Recent genomic investigations not only indicate that polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms, but also suggest several ancient genome-doubling events. These include ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events in basal angiosperm lineages, as well as a proposed paleohexaploid event that may have occurred close to the eudicot divergence. However, there is currently no evidence for WGD in Amborella, the putative sister species to other extant angiosperms. The question is no longer "What proportion of angiosperms are polyploid?", but "How many episodes of polyploidy characterize any given lineage?" New algorithms provide promise that ancestral genomes can be reconstructed for deep divergences (e.g., it may be possible to reconstruct the ancestral eudicot or even the ancestral angiosperm genome). Comparisons of diversification rates suggest that genome doubling may have led to a dramatic increase in species richness in several angiosperm lineages, including Poaceae, Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae. However, additional genomic studies are needed to pinpoint the exact phylogenetic placement of the ancient polyploidy events within these lineages and to determine when novel genes resulting from polyploidy have enabled adaptive radiations.},

Therefore, the sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods) genome possessed originally only half as many genes compared to the derived fishes, just like the most-basal and species-poor lineages of extant fishes that diverged from the fish stem lineage before the 3R duplication. Most duplicated genes were secondarily lost, yet some evolved new functions.

The stability of polyploids depends on rapid genome recombination and changes in gene expression after formation. The formation of polyploids and subsequent diploidization are important aspects in long-term evolution. Polyploids can be formed in various ways. Among them, hybrid organisms formed by distant hybridization could produce unreduced gametes and thus generate offspring with doubled chromosomes, which is a fast, efficient method of polyploidization. The formation of fertile polyploids not only promoted the interflow of genetic materials among species and enriched the species diversity, but also laid the foundation for polyploidy breeding. The study of polyploids has both important theoretical significance and valuable applications.

Excluding the gene we used to define homeologs, we found zero retention. Once retained, fractionation (loss of functioning DNA sequence) could occur within cis-acting gene space. We chose a retained duplicate basic leucine zipper transcription factor gene because it was well marked with big, exact phylogenetic footprints (CNSs). Detailed alignments of lg2 and retained duplicate lrs1 to their rice ortholog found that fractionation of conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) was rare, as expected. Of 30 CNSs, 27 were conserved. The 3 unexpected, missing CNSs and a large insertion support subfunctionalization as a reflection of fractionation of cis-acting gene space and the recent evolution of lg2's novel maize leaf and shoot developmental functions. In general, the principles of fractionation and consolidation work well in making sense of maize gene and genomic sequence data.},

	abstract = {Summary The study of the molecular evolution of cytochromes and haemoglobins permits to set forth the following points : 1. — It is possible to improve the study of the haemoglobin and cytochrome conformational dynamics by analysing, in comparative biochemistry, stable polypeptidic sequences which do not admit mutation. These active zones are quite stable as far as cytochromes are concerned and have little varied in the course of evolution whereas the genie systems of a, (3, y an({\textasciicircum} S chains of haemoglobins are comparatively more tolerant. The most tolerant functional molecules being fibrinopeptides. 2. — The study of cytochromes and more particularly of the С cytochrome permits to reconstruct molecular evolution history, much before the existence of primates, before the moment when the animal kingdom and the vegetal one became distinct. Such methods are likely to give one day, as Dickerson says, precise dates for events as remote as the separation of plants and animals, the origin of nucleate cells or even remote separations in life history. 3. — As for molecules such as globins, less ancient than cytochromes, one can say that the genes giving present human haemoglobins are about 950 million years old. Comparative molecular analysis permits to follow the evolution of the different polypeptidic chains from most ancient globins the present myoglobin can give an image of : — the genes giving the α and β chains of the present haemoglobins are about 500 to 600 years old ; — the genes giving the γ chains are more recent. They are no more than 200 million years old ; — the individualization of δ chains probably from β chains come far later the primates got separate. 4. — The immunological and immunoelectrophoretical study permits today — as far as other genie systems are concerned — to complete the individualization of human genome history and to give precisions about how old such genie systems are, in reference to hominisation : — the genes of ABO and MN systems appeared before hominisation ; — the genes of rhesus systems, strongly polyallelic, are contemporary with hominisation ; — genie systems defined by electrophoresis (immunoglobins, Gm and Inv systems) were at their best at the moment when races appeared. Therefore they constitute racial marking genes. — The genes which determine the abnormal HbS and HbE haemoglobins are still more recent since they cover only fragments of races. 5. — The study of this genie evolution seen through the molecular one has permitted us to set forth what we call « ECOLOGICAL MAGNIFICATION » given by mutated genes — which is particularly evident for the different haemoglobin chains. The inner or outer ecological conditions select the most convenient « allosteric transition ». 6. — The duplication of one gene on the same chromosome which is particulary evident for the genie systems of the globins is able to give numerous genes with strong adaptative potentiality. The genes of α and β chains illustrate what has just been said. 7. — Such ecological magnification can be noticed throughout animal world including human species with the appearance of « ECOPROTEINS » (α2γ2 and α2δ2 chains). These proteins which are new or pre-existing ones are likely to represent a process of physiological molecular adaptation, « an ecological feed-back ». The originality of ecoproteins derives from their allosteric function which is particular. That is probably the case for the globinical a2d2 and aoyo chains of fœtus proteins strongly responding to the oxygen factor. Besides haemoglobins, ecoproteins may represent, in some cases, allosteric effectors whose connections with allosteric locations depend on the environment, that is to say are « ecodependent » (ecoproteins are ecodependent proteins). 8. — We insist upon the importance of different types of mutations (Robertson fusion, duplication of one gene on the same chromosome, genie magnification, genie Testification). These facts associated with ecological magnification which takes place particularly when the best allosteric molecular transitions are selected permit to get a closer view upon the apparent evolutive accelerations in the course of evolution and upon hominisation in particular — even if « mutation rates » remain constant.},

	abstract = {Ever since the pre-molecular era, the birth of new genes with novel functions has been considered to be a major contributor to adaptive evolutionary innovation. Here, I review the origin and evolution of new genes and their functions in eukaryotes, an area of research that has made rapid progress in the past decade thanks to the genomics revolution. Indeed, recent work has provided initial whole-genome views of the different types of new genes for a large number of different organisms. The array of mechanisms underlying the origin of new genes is compelling, extending way beyond the traditionally well-studied source of gene duplication. Thus, it was shown that novel genes also regularly arose from messenger RNAs of ancestral genes, protein-coding genes metamorphosed into new RNA genes, genomic parasites were co-opted as new genes, and that both protein and RNA genes were composed from scratch (i.e., from previously nonfunctional sequences). These mechanisms then also contributed to the formation of numerous novel chimeric gene structures. Detailed functional investigations uncovered different evolutionary pathways that led to the emergence of novel functions from these newly minted sequences and, with respect to animals, attributed a potentially important role to one specific tissue--the testis--in the process of gene birth. Remarkably, these studies also demonstrated that novel genes of the various types significantly impacted the evolution of cellular, physiological, morphological, behavioral, and reproductive phenotypic traits. Consequently, it is now firmly established that new genes have indeed been major contributors to the origin of adaptive evolutionary novelties.},

	abstract = {Gene duplications increase genetic and phenotypic diversity and occur in complex genomic regions that are still difficult to sequence and assemble. PHD Finger Protein 7 (PHF7) acts during spermiogenesis for histone-to-histone protamine exchange and is a determinant of male fertility in Drosophila and the mouse. We aimed to explore and characterise in the chicken genome the expanding family of the numerous orthologues of the unique mouse Phf7 gene (highly expressed in the testis), observing the fact that this information is unclear and/or variable according to the versions of databases. We validated nine primer pairs by in silico PCR for their use in screening the chicken bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library to produce BAC-derived probes to detect and localise PHF7-like loci by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). We selected nine BAC that highlighted nine chromosomal regions for a total of 10 distinct PHF7-like loci on five Gallus gallus chromosomes: Chr1 (three loci), Chr2 (two loci), Chr12 (one locus), Chr19 (one locus) and ChrZ (three loci). We sequenced the corresponding BAC by using high-performance PacBio technology. After assembly, we performed annotation with the FGENESH program: there were a total of 116 peptides, including 39 PHF7-like proteins identified by BLASTP. These proteins share a common exon-intron core structure of 8-11 exons. Phylogeny revealed that the duplications occurred first between chromosomal regions and then inside each region. There are other duplicated genes in the identified BAC sequences, suggesting that these genomic regions exhibit a high rate of tandem duplication. We showed that the PHF7 gene, which is highly expressed in the rooster testis, is a highly duplicated gene family in the chicken genome, and this phenomenon probably concerns other bird species.},

	abstract = {Modern lampreys (Petromyzontiformes) are one of two lineages of surviving jawless fishes (agnathans), and are thus of critical importance to understanding the evolution of the vertebrates. Although their fossil record is meager, it appears they have remained morphologically conserved for at least 360 million years, but the origin of their multi-stage life history is unclear. Unlike hagfishes, the other extant group of jawless fishes, which exhibit direct development, all modern lampreys possess a complex life cycle which includes a long-lived freshwater larval (or ammocoete) period, followed by a true metamorphosis into a sexually-immature juvenile and then mature adult which differ dramatically in their morphology and ecology from the larva. Because of their basal position, it is critical to understand when the extant lamprey life history evolved, and if such a life history was present in the last common ancestor of agnathans and gnathostomes. Recent discoveries in paleontology, genomic analyses, and developmental biology are providing insights into this problem. The current review synthesizes these findings and concludes that the ancestral lamprey life cycle followed a direct development. We suggest that the larval period was short and relatively limited if present at all, but that the juvenile included modern larval traits; over the course of evolution, differential selection pressures throughout the lifetime produced distinct larval and juvenile/adult periods. Each period required the dramatically different morphologies seen in modern lampreys, ultimately requiring a true metamorphosis to accommodate the large changes in the body plan and to maximize the efficiency of each life period. As a result, modern lamprey life histories are a patchwork of ancestral and derived characters.},

Explanations of these two kinds of causality - the purviews of evolutionary biology and biochemistry, respectively - are typically pursued in isolation, but many fundamental questions fall squarely at the interface of fields. Here we articulate the paradigm of evolutionary biochemistry, which aims to dissect the physical mechanisms and evolutionary processes by which biological molecules diversified and to reveal how their physical architecture facilitates and constrains their evolution. We show how an integration of evolution with biochemistry moves us towards a more complete understanding of why biological molecules have the properties that they do.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.9994},
	abstract = {Salmonid fishes have emerged as a tractable model to study whole-genome duplications (WGDs) as this group has undergone four rounds of WGDs. While most of the salmonid genome has returned to a diploid state, a significant proportion of genes are maintained as duplicates and are referred to as ohnologs. The fact that much of the modern salmonid gene repertoire is comprised of ohnologs, while other genes have returned to their singleton state creates complications for genetic studies by obscuring homology relationships. The difficulty this creates is particularly prominent in Pacific salmonids belonging to genus Oncorhynchus who are the focus of intense genetics-based conservation and management efforts owing to the important ecological and cultural roles these fish play. To address this gap, we generated a homology guide for six species of Oncorhynchus with available genomes and used this guide to describe patterns of ohnolog retention and resolution. Overall, we find that ohnologs comprise approximately half of each species modern gene repertoires, which are functionally enriched for genes involved in DNA binding, while the less numerous singleton genes are heavily enriched in dosage-sensitive processes such as mitochondrial metabolism. Additionally, by reanalyzing published expression data from locally adapted strains of O. mykiss, we show that numerous ohnologs exhibit adaptive expression profiles; however, ohnologs are not more likely to display adaptive signatures than either paralogs or singletons. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our homology guide by investigating the evolutionary relationship among genes highlighted as playing a role in salmonid life-history traits or gene editing targets.},

	abstract = {From a database containing the published nuclear hormone receptor (NR) sequences I constructed an alignment of the C, D and E domains of these molecules. Using this alignment, I have performed tree reconstruction using both distance matrix and parsimony analysis. The robustness of each branch was estimated using bootstrap resampling methods. The trees constructed by these two methods gave congruent topologies. From these analyses I defined six NR subfamilies: (i) a large one clustering thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and ecdysone receptors (EcRs) as well as numerous orphan receptors such as RORs or Rev-erbs; (ii) one containing retinoid X receptors (RXRs) together with COUP, HNF4, tailless, TR2 and TR4 orphan receptors; (iii) one containing steroid receptors; (iv) one containing the NGFIB orphan receptors; (v) one containing FTZ-F1 orphan receptors; and finally (vi) one containing to date only one gene, the GCNF1 orphan receptor. The relationships between the six subfamilies are not known except for subfamilies I and IV which appear to be related. Interestingly, most of the liganded receptors appear to be derived when compared with orphan receptors. This suggests that the ligand-binding ability of NRs has been gained by orphan receptors during the course of evolution to give rise to the presently known receptors. The distribution into six subfamilies correlates with the known abilities of the various NRs to bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers. For example, receptors heterodimerizing efficiently with RXR belong to the first or the fourth subfamilies. I suggest that the ability to heterodimerize evolved once, just before the separation of subfamilies I and IV and that the first NR was able to bind to DNA as a homodimer. From the study of NR sequences existing in vertebrates, arthropods and nematodes, I define two major steps of NR diversification: one that took place very early, probably during the multicellularization event leading to all the metazoan phyla, and a second occurring later on, corresponding to the advent of vertebrates. Finally, I show that in vertebrate species the various groups of NRs accumulated mutations at very different rates.},

However, most applications and datasets involved in omics are gene or protein-centric requiring pathway representations that include direct and indirect interactions only between genes. Furthermore, special methodologies, such as Bayesian networks require acyclic representations of graphs. We developed KEGG2Net, a web resource that generates a network involving only the genes represented on a KEGG pathway with all of the direct and indirect gene-gene interactions deduced from the pathway. KEGG2Net offers four different methods to remove cycles from the resulting gene interaction network, converting them into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We generated synthetic gene expression data using the gene interaction networks deduced from the KEGG pathways and performed a comparative analysis of different cycle removal methods by testing the fitness of their DAGs to the data and by the number of edges they eliminate. Our results indicate that an ensemble method for cycle removal performs as the best approach to convert the gene interaction networks into DAGs. Resulting gene interaction networks and DAGs are represented in multiple user-friendly formats that can be used in other applications, and as images for quick and easy visualisation. The KEGG2Net web portal converts KEGG maps for any organism into gene-gene interaction networks and corresponding DAGS representing all of the direct and indirect interactions among the genes.},

The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions.

The study is based on serial semithin and ultrathin sections of material prepared for electron microscopy and antibodies to label radial glial cells, glial fibrillary acidic protein and Rat-401. Beginning on embryonic day 12, developing olfactory axons from the olfactory placode are accompanied by migratory cells, also derived from the olfactory placode, that reach the prospective olfactory bulb by embryonic day 13. The mass of migratory cells accumulate superficial to the telencephalic vesicle. The cells increase in number by mitotic divisions. The majority of these cells represent precursor elements that will later develop into the ensheathing cells of the olfactory nerves and olfactory nerve layer of the adult. Some migratory cells penetrate into the prospective olfactory bulb early during development. The first synaptic contacts of olfactory axons with dendritic processes in the olfactory bulb were observed at embryonic day 18. Glomerular formation is initiated by penetration of cells from the migratory mass into the prospective glomerular layer by embryonic day 20 to postnatal day 0. These cells form walls surrounding zones of high synaptic density forming protoglomeruli. Postnatally, the peripheral processes of radial glial cells branch profusely delimiting glomerular formations and transform into periglomerular astrocytes. Rat-401 stains radial glial cells from embryonic day 14. Immunoreactivity becomes restricted to the olfactory glomeruli during the first postnatal weeks and it virtually disappears by the end of the first postnatal month. We conclude that the early penetration of cells from the migratory mass into the prospective olfactory bulb, observed immediately after the first synaptic contacts were established, initiates the formation of olfactory glomeruli which becomes completed by the transformation of radial glial cells into periglomerular astrocytes.},

Accumulating studies on this topic have reported surprising cases of convergent evolution at the molecular level, ranging from gene families being recurrently recruited to identical amino acid replacements in distant lineages. Together, these different examples of genetic convergence suggest that molecular evolution is in some cases strongly constrained by a combination of limited genetic material suitable for new functions and a restricted number of substitutions that can confer specific enzymatic properties. We discuss approaches for gaining further insights into the causes of genetic convergence and their potential contribution to our understanding of how the genetic background determines the evolvability of complex organismal traits.},

In Drosophila and mammals, studies over the past decade have uncovered a critical role for the Hippo tumour-suppressor pathway in the regulation of organ size. Dysregulation of this pathway leads to massive overgrowth of tissue. The Hippo signalling pathway is highly conserved and limits organ size by phosphorylating and inhibiting the transcription co-activators YAP and TAZ in mammals and Yki in Drosophila, key regulators of proliferation and apoptosis. The Hippo pathway also has a critical role in the self-renewal and expansion of stem cells and tissue-specific progenitor cells, and has important functions in tissue regeneration. Emerging evidence shows that the Hippo pathway is regulated by cell polarity, cell adhesion and cell junction proteins. In this review we summarize current understanding of the composition and regulation of the Hippo pathway, and discuss how cell polarity and cell adhesion proteins inform the role of this pathway in organ size control and regeneration.},

	abstract = {Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have delineated a novel signalling pathway, the Hippo pathway, which has an important role in restraining cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in differentiating epithelia. Although this pathway is currently poorly characterized in mammals, several components of the Hippo pathway appear to function as tumour suppressors.The protein Fat, originally discovered in D. melanogaster as the founding member of a subfamily of genes called protocadherins, has been newly identified as an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway. The data suggest that Fat increases Hippo activity by two mechanisms: it modulates Hippo activity through phosphorylation and stabilizes the Warts protein (a central kinase of the Hippo signal transduction pathway).Two recent reports have identified a new transcriptional target downstream of the Hippo pathway in D. melanogaster that can promote tissue growth and inhibit apoptosis: the microRNA bantam. However, it remains unclear how bantam promotes cell proliferation and whether the mechanism(s) is conserved in mammals.In flies and mammals, Hippo signalling promotes apoptosis in response to irradiation. Recent work in D. melanogaster suggests that p53 is responsible for the activation of Hippo following irradiation, and that members of the Ras association family can temper this response.Loss of Hippo signalling allows cells in the developing fly to outcompete and eliminate neighbouring wild-type cells. This phenomenon is known as supercompetition. The mechanism(s) that enables Hippo-mutant cells to act as 'supercompetitors' remains unclear.Two unresolved questions pertaining to the Hippo pathway are: do extracellular ligands regulate Hippo activity by binding to Fat? And does the supercompetition phenotype of Hippo mutants contribute to mammalian tumorigenesis?},

	abstract = {The ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum scovillei causes severe anthracnose disease on the fruit of sweet pepper and chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) worldwide. Understanding the biology of C. scovillei would improve the management of fruit anthracnose diseases. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway regulates diverse cellular and physiological processes in several foliar fungal pathogens. We investigated the roles of the cAMP signaling pathway in C. scovillei using pharmaceutical and genetic approaches. Exogenous cAMP was found to increase conidiation, appressorium formation, and anthracnose disease development in C. scovillei. CsAc1, CsCap1, and CsPdeH, which regulate the intracellular cAMP level, were deleted by homology-dependent gene replacement. Expectedly, the intracellular cAMP level was significantly decreased in ΔCsac1 and ΔCscap1 but increased in ΔCspdeh. All three deletion mutants exhibited serious defects in multiple fungal developments and pathogenicity, suggesting regulation of the intracellular cAMP level is important for C. scovillei. Notably, exogenous cAMP recovered the defect of ΔCsac1 in appressorium development, but not penetration, which was further recovered by adding CaCl2. This result suggests that CsAc1 is associated with both the cAMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways in C. scovillei. ΔCscap1 produced morphologically abnormal conidia with reduced tolerance to thermal stress. ΔCspdeh was completely defective in conidiation in C. scovillei, unlike other foliar pathogens. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of cAMP signaling in anthracnose disease caused by C. scovillei.},

A yeast/mammal comparison suggests that network topology, and its associated dynamic properties, rather than regulatory proteins themselves may be the most important elements conserved through evolution. However, recent deep phylogenetic studies show that fungal and animal lineages are relatively closely related in the opisthokont branch of eukaryotes. The presence in plants of cell cycle regulators such as Rb, E2F and cyclins A and D, that appear lost in yeast, suggests cell cycle control in the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes was implemented with this set of regulatory proteins. Forward genetics in non-opisthokonts, such as plants or their green algal relatives, will provide direct information on cell cycle control in these organisms, and may elucidate the potentially more complex cell cycle control network of the last common eukaryotic ancestor.},

These findings are consistent with popular interpretations of Fisher's (1930, 1958) Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and Falconer (1960, 1981), but also indicate that high heritabilities are maintained within natural populations even for traits believed to be under strong selection.

	abstract = {Gene and genome duplications have given rise to enormous variability among species in the number of genes within their genomes. Gene copies have in turn played important roles in adaptation, having been implicated in the evolution of the immune response, insecticide resistance, efficient protein synthesis, and vertebrate body plans. In this chapter, we discuss the life history of gene duplications, from their first appearance within a population, through the period during which they rise in frequency or disappear, to their long-term fate. At each phase, we discuss the evolutionary processes that have influenced the dynamics of gene duplications and shaped their ultimate roles within a population. We argue that there is no evidence that organisms have evolved strategies to promote gene duplication in order to permit adaptive evolution. In contrast, many mechanisms exist to silence or eliminate duplicated genes, suggesting that selection has acted largely to reduce the rate of gene duplication. We also argue that natural selection has functioned as an effective sieve, increasing the representation of beneficial gene duplicates among those that establish within a population and that play a long-term role in evolution. To refine our understanding of how selection acts on new gene duplications, we provide a model incorporating a single-copy gene, its gene duplicate, and selection either favoring heterozygotes or eliminating deleterious mutations. Although both forms of selection can increase the initial rate of spread of a gene duplicate, the efficacy with which they do so differs dramatically. Heterozygote advantage always increases the rate of spread and can have a large impact. In contrast, masking deleterious mutations never has a large effect on the rate of spread of the duplicate, and this minor effect can be negative as well as positive. In both cases, the degree of linkage between the two gene copies affects the rate of spread of the duplication. Finally, we discuss evolutionary processes that occur over longer periods after a gene duplication has become established within a population. These long-term processes include maintenance, inactivation, and diversification in function. Consideration of each of the short-term and long-term processes affecting duplicated genes illustrates the subtle ways in which selection has acted to shape genomic structure.},

Therefore, a protein's position in a network may indicate how central it is to cellular function and, hence, how constrained it is evolutionarily. To look for an effect of position on evolutionary rate, we examined the protein-protein interaction networks in three eukaryotes: yeast, worm, and fly. We find that the three networks have remarkably similar structure, such that the number of interactors per protein and the centrality of proteins in the networks have similar distributions. Proteins that have a more central position in all three networks, regardless of the number of direct interactors, evolve more slowly and are more likely to be essential for survival. Our results are thus consistent with a classic proposal of Fisher's that pleiotropy constrains evolution.},

It has been proposed that such broad-tailed distributions are observed because they confer robustness against mutations to the network. We evaluate this hypothesis for two genetic networks, that of the E. coli core intermediary metabolism and that of the yeast protein-interaction network. Specifically, we test the hypothesis through one of its key predictions: highly connected proteins should be more important to the cell and, thus, subject to more severe selective and evolutionary constraints. We find, however, that no correlation between highly connected proteins and evolutionary rate exists in the E. coli metabolic network and that there is only a weak correlation in the yeast protein-interaction network. Furthermore, we show that the observed correlation is function-specific within the protein-interaction network: only genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription show significant correlations. Our work sheds light on conflicting results by previous researchers by comparing data from multiple types of protein-interaction datasets and by using a closely related species as a reference taxon. The finding that highly connected proteins can tolerate just as many amino acid substitutions as other proteins leads us to conclude that power-laws in cellular networks do not reflect selection for mutational robustness.},

We derived a parsimonious scenario ofgene losses for eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) from seven complete eukaryotic genomes. The scenario involves substantial gene loss in fungi, nematodes, and insects. Based on this evolutionary scenario and estimates of the divergence times between major eukaryotic phyla, we introduce a numerical measure, the propensity for gene loss (PGL). We explore the connection among the propensity of a gene to be lost in evolution (PGL value), protein sequence divergence, the effect of gene knockout on fitness, the number of protein-protein interactions, and expression level for the genes in KOGs. Significant correlations between PGL and each of these variables were detected. Genes that have a lower propensity to be lost in eukaryotic evolution accumulate fewer substitutions in their protein sequences and tend to be essential for the organism viability, tend to be highly expressed, and have many interaction partners. The dependence between PGL and gene dispensability and interactivity is much stronger than that for sequence evolution rate. Thus, propensity of a gene to be lost during evolution seems to be a direct reflection of its biological importance.},

We show that the connectivity of well-conserved proteins in the network is negatively correlated with their rate of evolution. Proteins with more interactors evolve more slowly not because they are more important to the organism, but because a greater proportion of the protein is directly involved in its function. At sites important for interaction between proteins, evolutionary changes may occur largely by coevolution, in which substitutions in one protein result in selection pressure for reciprocal changes in interacting partners. We confirm one predicted outcome of this process—namely, that interacting proteins evolve at similar rates.},

Reconstructing the ancestral vertebrate genome is highly nontrivial because of the difficulty in identifying traces originating from the 2R WGD. To resolve this problem, we developed a novel method capable of pinning down remains of the 2R WGD in the human and medaka fish genomes using invertebrate tunicate and sea urchin genes to define ohnologs, i.e., paralogs produced by the 2R WGD. We validated the reconstruction using the chicken genome, which was not considered in the reconstruction step, and observed that many ancestral proto-chromosomes were retained in the chicken genome and had one-to-one correspondence to chicken microchromosomes, thereby confirming the reconstructed ancestral genomes. Our reconstruction revealed a contrast between the slow karyotype evolution after the second WGD and the rapid, lineage-specific genome reorganizations that occurred in the ancestral lineages of major taxonomic groups such as teleost fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and marsupials.},

This difference may be largely due to the propensity of angiosperms to undergo chromosomal duplication ('polyploidization') and subsequent gene loss ('diploidization'); these evolutionary mechanisms have profound consequences for comparative biology. Here we integrate a phylogenetic approach (relating chromosomal duplications to the tree of life) with a genomic approach (mitigating information lost to diploidization) to show that a genome-wide duplication post-dates the divergence of Arabidopsis from most dicots. We also show that an inferred ancestral gene order for Arabidopsis reveals more synteny with other dicots (exemplified by cotton), and that additional, more ancient duplication events affect more distant taxonomic comparisons. By using partial sequence data for many diverse taxa to better relate the evolutionary history of completely sequenced genomes to the tree of life, we foster comparative approaches to the study of genome organization, consequences of polyploidy, and the molecular basis of quantitative traits.},

Here, using more appropriate methodology and a more recent version of the genome sequence annotation, we investigate the scale and timing of segmental duplications in Arabidopsis. We used protein sequence similarity searches to detect duplicated blocks in the genome, used the level of synonymous substitution between duplicated genes to estimate the relative ages of the blocks containing them, and analyzed the degree of overlap between adjacent duplicated blocks. We conclude that the Arabidopsis lineage underwent at least two distinct episodes of duplication. One was a polyploidy that occurred much more recently than estimated previously, before the Arabidopsis/Brassica rapa split and probably during the early emergence of the crucifer family (24–40 Mya). An older set of duplicated blocks was formed after the monocot/dicot divergence, and the relatively low level of overlap among these blocks indicates that at least some of them are remnants of a larger duplication such as a polyploidy or aneuploidy.},

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila  and Caenorhabditis elegans— the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamic nature of interfaces and of adhesion is reexamined in the light of the Lifshitz theory of the forces acting across condensed phases. A new term is proposed, γLW, which consists of the sum of the terms heretofore ascribed to London, Debye, and Keesom forces, LW referring to Lifshitz-van der Waals. This term and a second term γSR account for the entirety of two-phase interactions in nonionic systems; SR refers to short range forces. This new analysis of forces is of value in explaining some important biological and other phenomena. The rather strong attachment of hydrophilic proteins, e.g., human serum albumin (HSA) and human immunoglobulin G (IgG), to low energy surfaces, e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polystyrene (PST), while immersed in H2O, cannot be ascribed solely to Lifshitz-van der Waals forces (LW). For instance, it can be shown that the LW interaction would give rise to a repulsion between HSA and PTFE. The short range (SR) interactions, e.g., between H2O and HSA, are due to H-bonds, which cannot directly account for interactions with PTFE. However, the combined SR interfacial tensions between the H-bonding liquid, the biopolymer, and the low energy surface still result in a strong attraction between PTFE and HSA, immersed in H2O. This is analogous to the behavior of a liquid-air interface (where the fact that the direct interaction between a given solute and air is zero does not preclude the solute from being preferentially attracted to the interface). This SR attraction (minus the LW repulsion) between HSA and PTFE, in H2O, is of the same order of magnitude as the adsorption energy derived from the Langmuir isotherm obtained for this system. Analogous results are found with IgG and PTFE, and also with HSA and IgG, with PST. Desorption patterns (obtained by changing the γLW and γSR of the liquid medium) allow an insight into the degree of local dehydration (or “denaturation”) of adsorbed proteins under various conditions. It is suggested that the term interfacial forces more aptly describes the underlying mechanism than “hydrophobic interactions.”},

Nearly 50 molecules have been found to interact with type I collagen, and for about half of them, binding sites on this collagen have been elucidated. In addition, over 300 mutations in type I collagen associated with human connective tissue disorders have been described. However, the spatial relationships between the known ligand-binding sites and mutation positions have not been examined. To this end, here we have created a map of type I collagen that includes all of its ligand-binding sites and mutations. The map reveals the existence of several hot spots for ligand interactions on type I collagen and that most of the binding sites locate to its C-terminal half. Moreover, on the collagen fibril some potentially relevant relationships between binding sites were observed including the following: fibronectin- and certain integrin-binding regions are near neighbors, which may mechanistically relate to fibronectin-dependent cell-collagen attachment; proteoglycan binding may potentially impact upon collagen fibrillogenesis, cell-collagen attachment, and collagen glycation seen in diabetes and aging; and mutations associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and other disorders show apparently nonrandom distribution patterns within both the monomer and fibril, implying that mutation positions correlate with disease phenotype. These and other observations presented here may provide novel insights into evaluating type I collagen functions and the relationships between its binding partners and mutations.},

Our data provide evidence that at least 34 distinct Hox genes exist in the Japanese eel genome and that they represent eight Hox clusters. Duplication of Hox genes in the Japanese eel appears to be the result of the fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD) event. The Japanese eel shared the FSGD event with other teleosts such as zebrafish and pufferfish. A member of Hox paralog group one (HoxA1b) was preserved in the Japanese eel but was lost in other teleosts. Available Hox data revealed that the Hox cluster evolved distinctly in different teleost lineages. All duplicated Hox clusters were retained after the FSGD event in basal teleosts like in the Japanese eel, whereas crown teleosts lost one cluster (HoxCb or HoxDb). Based on current teleostean phylogeny, the HoxDb cluster was lost independently in the teleost lineages Otocephala and Euteleostei.},

Evolutionary conservation provides unlimited scope for experimental investigation of the functional control of the Hox gene network which is providing important insights into human disease. Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene, the human homologue of the Drosophila gene trithorax, create fusion genes which exhibit gain of function and are associated with aggressive leukaemias in both adults and children. To date 39 partner genes for MLL have been cloned from patients with leukaemia. Models based on specific translocations of MLL and individual HOX genes are now the subject of intense research aimed at understanding the molecular programs involved, and ultimately the design of chemotherapeutic agents for leukaemia.

Earlier indications of metazoans are found in the Neoproterozic; minute trails suggesting bilaterian activity date from about 600 million years ago. Larger and more elaborate fossil burrows appear near 543 million years ago, the beginning of the Cambrian Period. Evidence of metazoan activity in both trace and body fossils then increased during the 13 million years leading to the explosion. All living phyla may have originated by the end of the explosion. Molecular divergences among lineages leading to phyla record speciation events that have been earlier than the origins of the new body plans, which can arise many tens of millions of years after an initial branching. Various attempts to date those branchings by using molecular clocks have disagreed widely. While the timing of the evolution of the developmental systems of living metazoan body plans is still uncertain, the distribution of Hox and other developmental control genes among metazoans indicates that an extensive patterning system was in place prior to the Cambrian. However, it is likely that much genomic repatterning occurred during the Early Cambrian, involving both key control genes and regulators within their downstream cascades, as novel body plans evolved.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a recurrent event in human cancers and it promotes chromosomal instability and acquisition of aneuploidies1–8. However, the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in WGD cells and its contribution to oncogenic phenotypes are currently unknown. Here we show that in p53-deficient cells, WGD induces loss of chromatin segregation (LCS). This event is characterized by reduced segregation between short and long chromosomes, A and B subcompartments and adjacent chromatin domains. LCS is driven by the downregulation of CTCF and H3K9me3 in cells that bypassed activation of the tetraploid checkpoint. Longitudinal analyses revealed that LCS primes genomic regions for subcompartment repositioning in WGD cells. This results in chromatin and epigenetic changes associated with oncogene activation in tumours ensuing from WGD cells. Notably, subcompartment repositioning events were largely independent of chromosomal alterations, which indicates that these were complementary mechanisms contributing to tumour development and progression. Overall, LCS initiates chromatin conformation changes that ultimately result in oncogenic epigenetic and transcriptional modifications, which suggests that chromatin evolution is a hallmark of WGD-driven cancer.},

	abstract = {Bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) affect steroid synthesis in follicles and regulate cell proliferation in the ovaries of female animals. However, little is known about granular cells (GCs) in sheep. We identified the key BMP-6 receptors, activin receptor-like kinase(ALK-6), and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPRII) in sheep follicles using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). Both ALK-6 and BMPRII were expressed in the GC layer, GC membranes, and cytoplasm. We evaluated ALK-6 and BMPRII expression at the follicular development stage using quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting to detect sheep GCs from large, medium, and small follicles (diameters of ≥5, 2-5, and ≤2 mm, respectively). The mRNA abundance and protein expression of ALK-6 and BMPRII were significantly higher in GCs from large follicles compared to those in GCs from small follicles (P {\textless} 0.05) and were the lowest in GCs from medium follicles. To assess whether DHT affects ALK-6 and BMPRII expression in sheep GCs, we cultured GCs from large follicles in vitro then incubated them with DHT (10-11, 10-9, 10-7 M). We found that 10-7-M DHT significantly inhibited ALK-6 and BMPRII mRNA and protein (P {\textless} 0.05). We further explored whether DHT regulates ALK-6 and BMPRII through the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) pathway and found that 10-6-M flutamide, a non-selective androgen inhibitor, partially relieved the inhibitory effect of 10-7-M DHT on ALK-6 and BMPRII expression. Thus, GCs in sheep antral follicles differentially expressed ALK-6 and BMPRII at various stages, indicating that BMP-6 plays different roles to some extent during the development of antral follicles, and that high concentrations of DHT can inhibit the expression of ALK-6 and BMPRII via the androgen receptor pathway in sheep GCs. The present study aimed to determine the expression of the main BMP-6-related main receptors, namely, ALK-6 and BMPRII, during the development of GCs in sheep antral follicles and a potential mechanism of DHT regulation in sheep GCs. Our findings lay a foundation for the further exploration of the effects of ovarian BMP-6 expression on follicular development.},

Compared with the control group, the NF could significantly weaken the activity of T lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as decreased the activity of B lymphocytes and NK cell. NF significantly decreased the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+), whereas, it increased Tr percentage. In comparison with the NF group, the concentration of serum IL-2 and IL-4 showed an increase trend. Meanwhile, the granular cell macrophages colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) increased significantly in the 0.04\% NT group. The ratio of Th1/Th2 also showed an increasing trend after the supplements of NTs. There were no significant differences between the control and 0.04\% NT group. Nevertheless, no significant differences in weight gain and lymphoid organ indices were observed in our study. These results indicate that NT supplements can prevent hypoimmunity which result from NF diet. 0.04\% NTs is the healthy optimal supply proportion in mice diet.},

	abstract = {Purinergic nerves supply the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as mammals. Their cell bodies are located in Auerbach's plexus and their axons extend in an anal direction before innervating mainly the circular muscle coat. In the stomach they are controlled by preganglionic cholinergic fibres of parasympathetic origin. They are involved in "receptive relaxation" of the stomach, "descending inhibition" in peristalsis and reflex relaxation of oesophageal and internal anal sphincters. The terminal varicosities of purinergic nerves are characterised by a predominance of "large opaque vesicles," which can be distinguished from the "large granular vesicles" found in small numbers in both adrenergic and cholinergic nerves. Stimulation of purinergic nerves with single pulses produces hyperpolarisations of up to 25 mV (inhibitory junction potentials) in smooth muscle cells. These potentials are unaffected by atropine, adrenergic neuron blocking agents or sympathetic denervation, but are abolished by tetrodotoxin. The "rebound contraction" which characteristically follows cessation of purinergic nerve stimulation is probably due to prostaglandin. Evidence that ATP is the transmitter released from purinergic nerves includes: (1) synthesis and storage of ATP in nerves; (2) release of ATP from the nerves when they are stimulated; (3) exogenously applied ATP mimicking the action of nerve-released transmitter, both producing a specific increase in K+ conductance; (4) the presence of Mg-activated ATPase, 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase, enzymes which inactivate ATP; (5) drugs (including quinidine, some 2-substituted imidazolines, 2-2'pyridylisatogen and dipyridamole) which produce similar blocking or potentiating effects on the response to exogenously applied ATP and nerve stimulation. Speculations are made about the evolution and development of the nervous system, including the possibility that purinergic nerves are a primitive nerve type.},

	abstract = {The melatonin 1A receptor (MTNR1A) is a membrane receptor distributed across the mammalian gonadal axis-associated membrane. Melatonin (MT) can specifically bind with MTNR1A on the cell membrane and regulates mammalian reproductive activities. However, the role of MTNR1A in regulating the reproductive physiological activities of sheep in the Tibetan Plateau remains unclear. In this study, the MT content in Tibetan sheep blood during the estrous cycle was detected by ELISA. The distribution of MTNR1A in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect dynamic changes of MTNR1A mRNA and protein expression, and the protein distributions in the HPGA. The results showed that the average secretion level of MT in Tibetan sheep blood was highest occurred during diestrus and the lowest during proestrus. Additionally, the secretion of MT at night was significantly higher than during the day. The immunopositive products of MTNR1A were primarily distributed around the glial cells in the dorsal hypothalamic nucleus region, chromophobe cells, and eosinophilic cytoplasm in the pituitary gland, follicular granular layer, follicular adventitia, tubal mucosa, cilia, endometrium, interstices, and glands in the uterus. The expression trends of MTNR1A mRNA and proteins in the HPGA during the estrous cycle were the same. The relative expression levels of MTNR1A mRNA and proteins in the hypothalamus and ovaries were the highest during proestrus and the lowest during metestrus; the highest during diestrus in the pituitary and oviducts; the highest during metestrus in the uterus. Collectively, the differences in the secretion of MT in Tibetan sheep blood and the expression of MTNR1A in HPGA suggest that they may be affected by steroid hormone secretion during the estrous cycle of Tibetan sheep, which has a potential impact on the regulation of animal estrous cycle.},

	abstract = {The neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) is a GABAergic agonist that suppresses central nervous system (CNS) activity in the adult brain, and by reducing excitotoxicity is considered to be neuroprotective. A role for neurosteroids in the developing brain, particularly in late gestation, is still debated. The aim of this study was to investigate effects on proliferation and cell death in the brain of late gestation fetal sheep after inhibition of AP synthesis using finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase type 2 (5alpha-R2) inhibitor. Catheters were implanted in fetal sheep at approximately 125 days of gestation. At 3-4 days postsurgery, fetuses received infusions of either finasteride (20 mg/kg/h; n=5), the AP analogue alfaxalone (5 mg/kg/h; n=5), or finasteride and alfaxalone together (n=5). Brains were obtained at 24 h after infusion to determine cell death (apoptotic or necrotic) and cell proliferation in the hippocampus and cerebellum, areas known to be susceptible to excitotoxic damage. Finasteride treatment significantly increased apoptosis (activated caspase-3 expression) in hippocampal CA3 and CA1, and cerebellar molecular and granular layers, an effect abolished by co-infusion of alfaxalone and finasteride. Double-label immunohistochemistry showed that both neurons and astrocytes were caspase-3 positive. Finasteride treatment also increased the number of dead (pyknotic) cells in the hippocampus and cerebellum (Purkinje cells), but not when finasteride+alfaxalone was infused. Cell proliferation (Ki-67-immunoreactivity) increased after finasteride treatment; double-labeling showed the majority of Ki-67-positive cells were astrocytes. Thus, steroids such as AP appear to influence the constitutive rate of apoptosis and proliferation in the hippocampus and cerebellum of the fetal brain, and suggest an important role for neurosteroids in the development of the brain.},

Intergeneric porcine-ovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and intrageneric ovine-ovine SCNT embryos were constructed and the nucleolus ultrastructure and nucleolus associated rRNA synthesis examined in 1-, 2-, 4-, early 8-, late 8-, and 16-cell embryos using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and light microscopical autoradiography. In addition, immunocytochemical localization by confocal microscopy of nucleolin, a key protein involved in processing rRNA transcripts, was performed on early 8-, late 8-, and 16-cell embryos for both groups of SCNT embryos. Intergeneric porcine-ovine SCNT embryos exhibited nucleolar precursor bodies (NPBs) of an ovine (ruminant) ultrastructure, but no active rRNA producing fibrillo-granular nucleoli at any of the stages. Unusually, cytoplasmic organelles were located inside the nucleus of two porcine-ovine SCNT embryos. The ovine-ovine SCNT embryos, on the other hand, revealed fibrillo-granular nucleoli in 16-cell embryos. In parallel, autoradiographic labeling over the nucleoplasm, and in particular, the nulcleoli was detected. Bovine-ovine SCNT embryos at the eight-cell stage were examined for nucleolar morphology and exhibited ruminant-type NPBs as well as structures that appeared as fibrillar material surrounded by a rim of electron dense granules, perhaps formerly of nucleolar origin. Nucleolin was localized throughout the nucleoplasm and with particular intensity around the presumptive nucleolar compartments for all developmental stages examined in porcine-ovine and ovine-ovine SCNT embryos. In conclusion, this study suggests that factors within the ovine ooplasm are playing a role in the initial assembly of the embryonic nucleolus in intrageneric SCNT embryos.},

Recently, an excellent source of NKCF has been found to be the rat large granular lymphocyte (LGL) tumor (RNK) cell line. In this study, the kinetics of lysis of the NK-sensitive, tumor target YAC-1 by the RNK-NKCF was analyzed and found to parallel that seen with NK cell-mediated killing. RNK-NKCF was also capable of killing the NK-resistant target cell, MBL-2, over a longer time period. This study utilized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) prepared against granule protein, previously termed "anti-NKCF mAbs." These mAbs established the nature of RNK-NKCF as compared to other known cytotoxic factors in combination with studies that show that RNK-NKCF causes both 51Cr release and nuclear degradation. Antibody inhibition experiments have verified that RNK-NKCF is unique from tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leukoregulin, or complement. Anti-NKCF mAbs were capable, however, of neutralizing the RNK cell granule activity against YAC-1 tumor target cells. Based on these results, the ability of anti-NKCF mAbs to neutralize the cytolytic function of pore-forming protein (PFP), a component of these granules, was analyzed. In these experiments, the antibodies were found to inhibit the hemolytic activity of granules. Interestingly, the antibodies were effective in inhibiting the activity of unbound granule proteins as well as those bound to sheep red blood cell (SRBC) targets. Further studies to examine the target lysis requirements demonstrated that in contrast to PFP, the RNK-NKCF was able to lyse the tumor target in the absence of calcium. In addition, treatment of targets with RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors indicated that the mechanism of lysis of NKCF is quite unique from other defined cytotoxic moieties.},

	abstract = {New neurons are continuously added to the main olfactory bulb (MOB) of the mammalian brain. While their function has been demonstrated in olfactory learning, it is less known in an ethological context such as mothering. We addressed this question by investigating whether in sheep mothers the adult-generated olfactory neurons contribute to the processing of odors involved in attraction to lambs and in memorization of its individual signature. Parturient ewes, after having 2 days of contact with their lamb and being separated from them for 3 h, were exposed for 2 h either to their own lamb, an unfamiliar lamb or a familiar adult sheep and then sacrificed. A control group was composed of mothers not exposed to any lambs for 5 h before sacrifice. Bromodeoxyuridine, a marker of cell division, was injected 3 months before parturition and revealed through immunocytochemistry in combination with markers of activation or neuronal maturation. The percentage of adult-born cells activated in the granular layer of the MOB was compared between the four groups. Results show that the whole population of olfactory neuroblasts and in particular the 3-month-old neuroblasts, are preferentially activated by lamb exposure and that the preferential activation is specific to olfactory neurogenesis since no activation was observed in newborn neurons of the dentate gyrus. However, neither neuroblasts nor mature neurons of the MOB differentiate between familiar and unfamiliar lamb exposure. Therefore, our data shows that adult-born neurons contribute to the processing of infantile odors which are determinant for maternal behavior.},

The clones were cultured for more than 30 generations (i.e., more than 10(9) descendants from a single cell). The rapid expansion was achieved by using a special culture system developed for this purpose and based on the use of two types of allogeneic feeder cells. Three phenotypically different types of cytotoxic clones were obtained. These clones showed a broad spectrum of cytolytic activity against several NK-susceptible and NK-nonsusceptible tumor target cells. One of these clones had the following binding pattern to MCA: B73 .1+, T3-, T4-, T8-, HNK1 -, and Lyt-3-. These cells formed rosettes with IgG-coated erythrocytes but not with sheep erythrocytes, and therefore might be null cell-derived. Most of the cytotoxic clones showed the following phenotype: B73 .1+, T3-, T4-, T8-, HNK1 -, Lyt-3+, E+, and EA-gamma +. These clones were probably derived from T-gamma cells. In addition, one clone with cytolytic activity was derived from B73 .1- cells. This had the phenotype B73 .1-, T3+, T4-, T8-, HNK1 -, Lyt-3+, E+, and EA-gamma-, and may be of T-non-gamma cell origin. About 10 noncytolytic clones showed the phenotype B73 .1-, T3+, T4, or T8+, HNK1 -, Lyt-3+, Ia+, E+, and EA-gamma -. An absolute correlation was found between the presence of the B73 .1 antigen, the absence of the T3 marker, and the capacity of the cells to form EA rosettes. Furthermore, all clones except one (Lyt-3-) formed E rosettes. Although the in vitro life span varied from clone to clone, B73 .1- clones generally grew faster and for longer times (greater than or equal to 50 generations) than did B73 .1+ ones (less than or equal to 40 generations). The cytolytic activity, cell surface phenotype as determined with MCA, rosette formation, and target cell specificity spectrum remained stable over the entire culture period. We conclude that the majority of the activated MHC-nonrestricted cytolytic clones obtained in this culture system show a particular phenotype. These cells can be expanded to large numbers. Whether or not these clones might be derived from B73 .1+, HNK1 + NK cells with the morphologic appearance of large granular lymphocytes will be discussed.},

Synthetic ovine corticoliberin-immunoreactive fibres were detected, in order of decreasing importance, in the external median eminence, in the caudal neural lobe around capillaries, at the boundary of the neural and intermediate lobe, around the anterior commissure, in the paraventricular nuclei and in the posterior hypothalamus and midbrain, suggesting that synthetic ovine corticoliberin-related substances act not only on anterior pituitary tissue, but also on the intermediate lobe, on central neurones and on peripheral target organs. Two groups of cell bodies reacted to the anti-synthetic ovine corticoliberin antiserum. The first group was located in the paraventricular nuclei and consisted of 15-20 microns diameter cell bodies with a granular cytoplasm. The second group was located mainly in the dorsolateral caudal hypothalamus, and the cell bodies were smaller (10-15 microns) and had a smooth cytoplasm. No cell bodies were detected in the basal hypothalamus). Synthetic ovine corticoliberin-immunoreactive structures did not contain immunoreactive neurophysin. The synthetic ovine corticoliberin-immunoreaction in the paraventricular neurones was abolished by preincubating the antiserum with synthetic ovine corticoliberin but not with sauvagine or several other peptides. The immunoreaction in the posterior hypothalamic groups was abolished by preincubating the synthetic ovine corticoliberin antiserum with both synthetic ovine corticoliberin and sauvagine, but not with other peptides. The results suggest that the immunoreaction was specific for synthetic ovine corticoliberin in the paraventricular but not posterior hypothalamic region. The relative contribution of both areas to synthetic ovine corticoliberin-like peptides containing nerve terminals of the median eminence remains to be established.},

	abstract = {Alz-50 is a monoclonal antibody raised against ventral forebrain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was originally believed that the antigen recognized by Alz-50 was only found in degenerating neurons. However, recent studies indicate that Alz-50 stains neurons in a limited but specific distribution in normal brains throughout life. As the antigen recognized by Alz-50 in normal brains may give some insight into the AD degenerative process, we characterized Alz-50 staining in the normal ovine striatum using immunoblots and immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels. We then compared the Alz-50 staining pattern with those of NADPH diaphorase histochemistry and immunocytochemistry using antisera against several neuropeptides, Alzheimer-related proteins, and heat-shock proteins. Western blot analysis indicated that the epitope recognized by Alz-50 in the normal sheep brain is on the microtubule-associated protein tau, and preadsorbing Alz-50 with a peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of the tau molecule eliminated staining. Alz-50 labeled a single population of cells in the ovine striatum, the medium aspiny neurons. At the light microscope level, the granular staining pattern closely resembled Alz-50 immunoreactive neurons in the normal human striatum and in cells undergoing early degeneration in AD. Alz-50 immunoreactive neurons stained immunocytochemically with antisera against somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, and histochemically for NADPH diaphorase. These cells were morphologically characterized by smooth dendrites, elaborate local axonal plexuses, and indented nuclei with filamentous inclusions. Ultrastructurally, Alz-50 immunodecorated ribosomes and membranous structures (e.g. vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum), and many boutons which contained Alz-50-positive synaptic vesicles. None of the antisera against other Alzheimer-related proteins, including paired helical filament protein, ubiquitin, beta-amyloid protein, or heat-shock proteins specifically stained the population of cells labelled by Alz-50. Other tau antisera also did not specifically stain these cells. We conclude that Alz-50 recognizes an amino terminal epitope that is exposed on tau proteins within a single, discrete population of neurons in the normal sheep striatum. The presence of this epitope in a normal cell population raises the possibility that the early stages of AD degeneration may involve the activation of a normal cellular pathway that modifies the tau molecule.},

Major proteins in mouse CTL granules are a family of seven serine proteases designated granzymes A to G, and a pore-forming protein called perforin (cytolysin). Purified perforin is cytolytic in the presence of Ca2+ and shows ultrastructural, immunological and amino-acid sequence similarities to complement component C9. Despite these similarities, perforin and C9 are clearly distinct in their mode of target-cell recognition. Whereas C9 insertion is absolutely dependent on a receptor moiety assembled from the complement proteins C5b, C6, C7, and C8 on the target-cell membrane, no requirement for a receptor molecule has been reported for perforin. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylcholine acts as a specific, Ca2+-dependent receptor molecule for perforin.},

Twenty naturally affected Scrapie sheep and 6 matched controls were used. Eyes, optic nerves and brain from each animal were fixed and histologically processed using hematoxylin-eosin, followed by immunohistochemical staining for prion protein (PrPsc) and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP). Retinal histopathological changes were observed in only 7 clinically affected animals and mainly consisted of loss of outer limitant layer definition, outer plexiform layer atrophy, disorganization and loss of nuclei in both nuclear layers, and Müller glia hypertrophy. PrPsc was detected in the retina of 19 of the 20 sheep and characterized by a disseminated granular deposit across layers and intraneuronally in ganglion cells. The inner plexiform and the ganglion cell layers were the structures most severely affected by PrPsc deposits. PrPsc exhibited a tendency to spread from these two layers to the others. A marked increase in the number and intensity of GFAP-expressing Müller cells was observed in the clinical stage, especially at the terminal stage of the disease. Spongiosis and PrPsc were detected within the visual pathways at the preclinical stage, their values increasing during the course of the disease but varying between the areas examined. PrPsc was detected in only 3 optic nerves. The results suggest that the presence of PrPsc in the retina correlates with disease progression during the preclinical and clinical stages, perhaps using the inner plexiform layer as a first entry site and diffusing from the brain using a centrifugal model.},

	abstract = {Normal as well as transformed epidermal cells (EC) have recently been reported to produce a cytokine--EC-derived thymocyte-activating factor (ETAF), which according to its biologic as well as biochemical properties is indistinguishable from macrophage-derived interleukin 1 (IL 1). In the present study, the effect of supernatants (SN) derived from normal EC and a human squamous carcinoma cell (SCC) line were tested for their effects on natural killer (NK) cell activity. EC- as well as SCC-derived SN were able to augment in vitro NK cell activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes against K 562 cells. In contrast, adherent cell-derived, IL 1-containing SN did not affect NK cell activity. Upon high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration, ETAF and the EC-derived NK cell activity-augmenting factor (ENKAF) exhibited a similar m.w. However, by using reverse-phase HPLC, ETAF and ENKAF eluted as distinct peaks of activity, indicating that SCC cell-derived ENKAF is different from ETAF. Furthermore, ENKAF does not contain interleukin 2 (IL 2) or interferon (IFN) activity. The enhancement of NK cell activity was dose dependent and evident after 20 hr of preincubation of effector cells. Pretreatment of target cells with ENKAF did not affect the susceptibility of the target cells. The NK activity of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) purified by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation and further depleted of high-affinity sheep erythrocyte rosetting cells was enhanced by ENKAF. In contrast, no NK cell activity was expressed by LGL-depleted T cell populations before or after treatment with ENKAF. In a single cell cytotoxicity assay in agarose, the number of lymphocyte binding to K 562 was not affected by ENKAF, but the frequency of dead conjugated target cells and presumably of active killer cells was increased by pretreatment with ENKAF. Additional incubation of LGL with ETAF did not further increase ENKAF-mediated augmentation of NK activity. In contrast to ETAF, ENKAF was not chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These results indicate that normal as well as transformed EC release a unique cytokine--ENKAF--which augments NK cell activity of LGL but is distinct from ETAF, IL 2, and IFN.},

We have examined changes in immunoreactivity staining for the steroidogenic enzymes cholesterol P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc), and 5alpha-reductase type-2 in the cerebellum of late gestation (130-145 days gestation) fetal sheep and newborn lambs (1-4 weeks of age). Both enzymes were predominantly localized in the Purkinje cell body and dendrites of the fetal and newborn cerebellum, with weaker immunoreactivity in a few cells of the inner granular layer. P450scc immunoreactivity was present in Purkinje neurons expressing either of the neuronal microtubule associated proteins MAP1b/5 or MAP2a/b, but was absent from GFAP and HNK-1 positive cells. Soma of Purkinje neurons were also immunopositive for 5alpha-reductase type-2 in the fetuses, but expression decreased to just detectable levels in the 1-2 and 2-4 week old lambs. Both MAP1b/5- and MAP2a/b-positive Purkinje neurons showed 5alpha-reductase type-2 expression in the fetus, whereas the residual 5alpha-reductase staining in the newborn lamb was present only in MAP2a/b-positive Purkinje neurons. Allopregnanolone in the cerebellum decreased from 21.8+/-1.9 ng/g wet weight in fetuses at 140-145 days gestation to 6.7+/-0.5 ng/g in 2-4 week old lambs (P{\textless}0. 05). Thus, synthesis of neuroactive steroids from cholesterol is possible in cerebellar neurons in late gestation and persists into neonatal life, 5alpha-reductase type-2 expression is greater in the fetus compared to the neonate, and allopregnanolone concentrations in the cerebellum decrease significantly after birth.},

	abstract = {The effect of Parotis virus on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro (ADCC) of human lymphocytes was investigated in a 51Cr-release assay and, at the effector cell level, in an ADCC plaque assay. Target cells were bovine or chicken erythrocytes, which are not susceptible to natural cytotoxicity (NK) of human lymphocytes. They were not killed when incubated with virus-treated lymphocytes in the absence of antibodies. Treatment of the lymphocytes or the target cells with small amounts of virus, however, resulted in a very significant enhancement of ADCC. The same results were obtained with live or UV-inactivated virus, suggesting that enhancement was a passive phenomenon not requiring infection. Enhancement was already significant after 3 hr of incubation, indicating that it was independent of endogenously released interferon. Enhancement of ADCC by virus was due to effector cell recruitment rather than due to the increase of the cytotoxic potential of the individual K cell. The highest frequency of effector cells was present in Percoll fractions enriched in large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Virus treatment resulted in recruitment of effector cells carrying T cell markers such as the T3 antigen (OKT3+), receptors for sheep erythrocytes, or Fc receptors for IgM. In contrast, the absolute number of K cells carrying the HNK-1 marker (Leu-7) or receptors for C3 fragments was not changed by the virus. It is concluded that Parotis virus enhances ADCC by improving effector cell-target cell contacts, resulting in recruitment of effector cells with T cell characteristics. Recruitment is accompanied by a significant reduction of the antibody concentration needed for ADCC induction. This virus-mediated enhancement of ADCC may be of importance for protection of the host in the early phases of a virus infection in which the amounts of anti-viral IgG antibodies capable of inducing cellular cytotoxicity may yet be very small.},

The frequency of lymphocytes bearing the OKM1 marker and the frequency of T3+, T4+, T8+, Ia+, Mo1+, Mo2+ and B1+ cells was normal among sheep erythrocyte rosetting (E+) and non-rosetting (E-) peripheral blood leucocytes analysed by flow cytofluorography. Cells expressing the NK shared markers, OKM1, mac-1, FcR, and the characteristic large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology of NK cells were also present in normal numbers in the highly enriched NK fraction separated on Percoll density gradients. This fraction did not contain detectable numbers of cells expressing the Mo2 marker of human monocytes. Therefore most of the cells stained by monoclonal OKM1 and mac-1 in this fraction are likely NK cells, rather than monocytes, and we conclude that the size of the NK pool in CH patients is probably normal. The capacity of CH lymphocytes to recognize and bind to tumour cells was also normal as was the subsequent burst of oxygen intermediates produced by the NK cells in a chemiluminenscence assay. We have shown elsewhere that O2- generation is directly involved in activating subsequent steps in the NK cytolytic pathway. These results suggest that NK cells in CH patients are present in normal frequency but are blocked at some post-recognition, post-activation step in the cytolytic pathway subsequent to the burst of oxygen intermediates but preceding the lethal hit.},

Central nervous system neurons were enlarged with finely to coarsely granular cytoplasmic material, or less often, neurons were distended with multiple, variably-sized vacuoles. Loss of neurons without gliosis was evident and the Nissl substance was either dispersed and fragmented or condensed around the nuclei of remaining neurons. Neurons of intestinal and other peripheral ganglia, retinal ganglion cells, and heart Purkinje fibers were enlarged similarly. White matter of the cerebrum and spinal cord had numerous spheroid to ellipsoid axonal enlargements. Periportal hepatocytes and renal epithelial cells were enlarged with marked vacuolation.

Examination of IgG deposition using fluorescent anti-mouse IgG revealed a similar granular pattern and degree of staining in both immunized groups. Control animals that received concurrent T4 administration alone showed similar hTg-induced murine thyroiditis to non-T4-treated animals and could not explain the apparent immunosuppression observed.

Increase in serum IgE concentration is the hallmark of this disease. To determine if mercury vapours have pathogenic effects is an important problem of public health. The aim of this study was, first to compare the effects of mercury vapour exposure to those of mercury injections and, second, to compare the effects of high doses to those of low doses of mercury. Two exposure levels were studied corresponding to a mercury absorption of 13.1 mumol/week per kg body wt. and 1.7 mumol/week per kg body wt. during a 5-week period. It will be shown that, whereas the mercury concentration in the kidneys was similar in injected--and vapour exposed--rats, the mercury concentration in blood at the end of the exposure was about twice as high in the injected animals. Blood concentration of mercury was related to dose level but kidney content of mercury was similar in all groups, in spite of a dose difference by a factor of seven between low and high exposure. Mercury vapour and HgCl2 injections both trigger autoimmunity to the same extent and, in both cases the extent of autoimmune manifestations was dose-dependent.},

We have determined the effects of two 10-min UCO on the distribution of the lipid peroxidation marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and the activated form of the apoptosis marker caspase-3 in the brains of late-gestation fetal sheep. UCO caused asphyxia, hypertension, and bradycardia, but these parameters normalized 2 h after the occlusion. At postmortem, 48 h after the second UCO there were significantly higher numbers of 4-HNE-positive cells in all layers of the hippocampus and cerebellum, the parietal cortex, substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus compared with control brains. 4-HNE immunoreactivity was also found in white matter tracts of the subcallosal bundle, external medullary lamina, reticular thalamic nucleus, and cerebellar fiber tracts only in UCO brains. Double-labeling identified these cells as predominantly neurons and astrocytes, with oligodendrocytes showing lower levels of 4-HNE immunoreactivity. After UCO, the number of caspase-3-immunopositive cells was increased significantly in the hippocampal CA1, molecular layer and dentate gyrus, ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, putamen, and cerebellar granular and molecular layers compared with controls. Double-labeling revealed caspase-3 immunoreactivity was mainly in neurons, and to lesser extent in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Pyknotic cell numbers were significantly increased in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, parietal cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and cerebellar Purkinje cells after UCO.

	abstract = {1. The distribution of specific proteins in sympathetic neurones has been examined by immunofluorescent histology using antibodies prepared against soluble protein components of the catecholamine storage vesicles of the adrenal medulla.2. Two antigen preparations were separated by ion exchange chromatography of the soluble proteins released on osmotic lysis of catecholamine storage vesicles which had been isolated by centrifugation from homogenates of sheep adrenal medulla. One fraction (AgDH) had high dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity, while another (AgCB), consisting of the bulk of the protein, had some capacity to bind catecholamines. On disk gel electrophoresis the antigens ran as single bands with very different mobilities.3. Antisera (AsDH) and (AsCB) produced in rabbits to the two antigens were shown to react specifically with their antigens by immunodiffusion and electrophoresis in agarose.4. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of tissue sections was achieved by layering first the rabbit anti-sera, followed by goat anti-rabbit globulin serum which had been conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate.5. The adrenal medulla and the cell bodies of sympathetic ganglia showed the most intense green fluorescence with the immune rabbit sera, and hardly stained when pre-immune serum from the same animal was used. The reactivity of the antisera could be abolished by incubation with the corresponding antigen.6. The preterminal and terminal axons of sympathetic nerves also stained specifically but less intensely with both antisera. When the nerves were ligated for up to 24 hr, the portion immediately proximal to the constriction showed an enhanced reaction to the antisera.7. The results provide evidence that sympathetic neurones contain proteins immunologically identical to those involved in the synthesis and storage of noradrenaline in the adrenal medulla, and support the concept that granular vesicles are synthesized in the perikaryon of the neurone and are transported somatofugally in the axon.},

Data base searches indicate that this gene encodes a novel prototype galectin that contains one putative carbohydrate recognition domain and exhibits most identity to galectin-9/ecalectin, a potent eosinophil chemoattractant. The sugar binding properties of the recombinant molecule were confirmed by a hemagglutination assay and lactose inhibition. The mRNA and protein of galectin-14 are expressed at high levels in eosinophil-rich cell populations. Flow cytometry and cytospot staining demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasmic, but not the granular, compartment of eosinophils. In contrast, galectin-14 mRNA and protein were not detected in neutrophils, macrophages, or lymphocytes. Western blot analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicates that galectin-14 is released from eosinophils into the lumen of the lungs after challenge with house dust mite allergen. The restricted expression of this novel galectin to eosinophils and its release into the lumen of the lung in a sheep asthma model indicates that it may play an important role in eosinophil function and allergic inflammation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The slit diaphragm plays a critical role in maintaining the barrier function of the glomerular capillary wall. The pathogenic mechanism of proteinuria in membranous nephropathy remains uncertain. This study was undertaken to analyze the pathogenic role of slit diaphragm in proteinuria in experimental membranous nephropathy.
METHODS: The expression and the localization of slit diaphragm-associated molecules (nephrin, podocin, and CD2AP) and other podocyte-associated molecules (podocalyxin and alpha(3) integrin) in passive and active Heymann nephritis were analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The interaction of slit diaphragm-associated molecules was investigated by the dual-labeling immunofluorescence method. The mRNA expression of these molecules was also analyzed.
RESULTS: Shifts in nephrin and podocin staining patterns, from linear to granular, were detected in the early stages of passive Heymann nephritis. These shifts were not parallel, and the dissociation of these molecules was detected by the dual-labeling immunofluorescence method in passive and active Heymann nephritis. Western blot analyses with sequentially solubilized materials indicated that the nephrin-rich fraction changed from being partly detergent-resistant to being predominantly detergent-soluble. This change did not occur with podocin. Nephrin excreted into urine was already detected in the early stages of passive Heymann nephritis. Decreased mRNA expression of nephrin and podocin was observed before the onset of proteinuria. By contrast, no extensive change in the expression of alpha(3) integrin was observed in this study.
CONCLUSION: Nephrin is dissociated from podocin and excreted into urine in the early stages of Heymann nephritis. The reduced expression of nephrin and podocin, along with their dissociation, may contribute to the development of proteinuria in Heymann nephritis.},

It is also present in Fx1A, the renal tubular preparation used to immunize rats to induce active Heymann nephritis (HN), a model of membranous nephropathy. We hypothesized that rats immunized with anti-Fx1A develop autoantibodies (auto-Abs) to Crry as well as to the megalin-containing HN antigenic complex, and that anti-Crry Abs promote the development of injury in HN by neutralizing the complement regulatory activity of Crry. Rats immunized with Fx1A lacking Crry remained free of proteinuria and glomerular deposits of C3 during a 10-wk follow-up despite typical granular immunoglobulin (Ig)G deposits in glomeruli. Anti-Fx1A auto-Abs were present in their sera at levels that were not different from sera pooled from proteinuric rats with HN induced with nephritogenic Fx1A. Passive administration of sheep anti-Crry Abs to rats immunized with Crry-deficient Fx1A led to proteinuria and glomerular C3 deposition, which were not seen in such rats injected with preimmune IgG, nor in rats with collagen-induced arthritis injected with anti-Crry IgG. To directly examine the role of Crry in HN, rats were immunized with Crry-deficient Fx1A reconstituted with rCrry. This led to typical HN, with 8 out of 15 rats developing proteinuria within 14 wk. Moreover, the extent of glomerular C3 deposition correlated with proteinuria, and anti-Crry Abs were present in glomerular eluates. Thus, Crry is a key nephritogenic immunogen in Fx1A. Formation of neutralizing auto-Abs to Crry impairs its function, leading to unrestricted complement activation by Abs reactive with the HN antigenic complex on the epithelial cell surface.},

	abstract = {To investigate the role of glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) membrane proteins in the in situ formation of subepithelial immune deposits, the authors raised a rabbit antiserum against GEC that had been grown in culture (anti-GEC). By indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on normal rat kidney, anti-GEC stained proximal tubular brush border (BB). After intravenous injection into animals, granular glomerular capillary wall staining for IgG was present by IE and subepithelial immune deposits were identified by standard transmission and immunoelectron microscopy. Using the latter technique, injected anti-GEC IgG was identified beneath slit diaphragms and in endocytic-coated pits and intracellular vesicles of podocytes. Anti-GEC immunoprecipitated gp330 and two other proteins from radiolabeled BB. These proteins also were identified by sheep anti-rat Fx1A, the antiserum responsible for passive Heymann nephritis. Anti-GEC and anti-Fx1A also immunoprecipitated five identical proteins from surface-labeled GEC. Biosynthetically-labeled but not surface-labeled GEC contained immunoprecipitable gp330. Thus, injection into rats of antibodies raised against cultured GEC can produce subepithelial immune deposits, a disease process classically induced by antibodies to BB or its purified components. In addition to gp330, GEC and BB share other antigenic determinants that may contribute to the formation of these immune deposits.},

In the conventional method, it is necessary to purify the indicator cells in upper chamber because it is impossible to distinguish inflammatory cells on the chemotactic membrane. For example, when we estimate T lymphocyte chemotaxis, we collected nylon-wool nonadherent peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and confirmed their purity by sheep erythrocytes rosette formation assay. Pohajdak et al (12) evaluated NK cell chemotaxis by using large granular lymphocytes (LGL) for indicator cells. LGL fractionation was confirmed by monoclonal antibodies, HNK-1, OKT11, OKT3, OKT4, OKT8, OKM1, and MO2. When we arranged the study to evaluate chemotaxis of lymphocyte subsets which were divided by surface antigens, the conventional method needed a large quantity of PBL for the indicator cells. Moreover, one or two lymphocyte subsets had to be obtained from an identical PBL donor. This was time consuming. So, we tried to identify migrating lymphocytes in the chemotaxis membrane by their surface antigens. In this communication, we report that the staining of surface antigens on migrating lymphocytes in the chemotaxis membrane is effective and useful for evaluation of lymphocyte subset chemotaxis. It prompted us to report the new findings about modification of lymphocyte subset chemotaxis by C5a.},

In contrast, cells with natural killer (NK) activity against K562 erythroleukaemia cells were located in both OKM1- and OKT10-positive and -negative cells. At centrifugation on Percoll density gradients, cells with NK activity and IFN response against SACoI were recovered from light gradient fractions that contained mainly large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Furthermore, the IFN producers were enriched by removal of sheep erythrocyte-rosetting T cells from the Percoll fractions.

	abstract = {Secretory granules of sheep thyroid parafollicular cells contain serotonin, a serotonin-binding protein, and calcitonin. Parafollicular cells, isolated by affinity chromatography, were found to secrete serotonin when activated by thyrotropin (TSH) or elevated [Ca2+]e. TSH also induced a rise in [Ca2+]i. We studied the effect of these secretogogues on the pH difference (delta pH) across the membranes of the secretory granules of isolated parafollicular cells. The trapping of the weak bases, acridine orange or 3-(2,4 dinitro anilino)-3'-amino-N-methyl dipropylamine (DAMP), within the granules was used to evaluate delta pH. In contrast to lysosomes, which served as an internal control, the secretory granules of resting parafollicular cells displayed a limited and variable ability to trap either acridine orange or 3-(2,4 dinitro anilino)-3'-amino-N-methyl dipropylamine; however, when parafollicular cells were stimulated with TSH or elevated [Ca2+]e, the granules acidified. Weak base trapping was also used to evaluate the ATP-driven H+ translocation into isolated parafollicular granules. The isolated parafollicular granules did not acidify in response to addition of ATP unless their transmembrane potential was collapsed by the K+ ionophore, valinomycin. Secretory granules isolated from TSH-treated parafollicular cells had a high chloride conductance than did granules isolated similarly from untreated cells. Furthermore, ATP-driven H+ translocation into parafollicular granules isolated from TSH-stimulated parafollicular cells occurred even in the absence of valinomycin. These results demonstrate that secretogogues can regulate the internal pH of the serotonin-storing secretory granules of parafollicular cells by opening a chloride channel associated with the granule membrane. This is the first demonstration that the pH of secretory vesicles may be modified by altering the conductance of a counterion for the H+ translocating ATPase.},

These changes particularly affected mitochondria, which were enlarged, rounded and showed replacement of their normal lamelliform cristae by thin elongated cristal elements and bundles of tubular "rod-like" structures. Quantitative morphometric studies showed an increase in the volumes of zona glomerulosa cells, nuclei, mitochondria, smooth and granular endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi profiles. In contrast, with dietary sodium loading, zona glomerulosa cells appeared shrunken and showed cytoplasmic lipid accumulation; mitochondria and other organelles were not significantly altered. The correlation of the ultrastructural cytological alterations in zona glomerulosa cells in sodium-depleted sheep with raised blood aldosterone levels suggests that such morphologic changes reflect a heightened capacity of these cells for aldosterone biosynthesis and secretion. These changes may also account for the increased sensitivity of the zona glomerulosa to aldosterone-producing stimuli during sodium deficiency.},

In addition, both B lymphocytes and T cells with receptors for the Fc of IgG (T gamma cells) were larger lymphocytes with more abundant cytoplasm and usually displayed scattered granular acid phosphatase activity; in esterase preparations both cell types were either negative or possessed similar scattered granular positivity. As compared with T mu cells, T gamma cells were seen to form loose spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. Combined esterase and acid phosphatase staining showed that both enzyme activities in the T mu cells are localized in the same area, and ultrastructural acid phosphatase cytochemistry established that this was in distinctive lysosomal structures.

	abstract = {A monoclonal antibody (mAb), CLB/FcR gran I, reactive with the CD16 Fc receptor (FcRlo/FcRIII) of human cells, leads to calcium mobilization in large granular lymphocytes (LGL) but not in granulocytes. Identical responses are obtained with F(ab')2 fragments of this antibody, indicating that the response is independent of Fc-FcR binding, and that bivalent cross-linking of this receptor is adequate for optimal calcium mobilization. The calcium response was greater in CD3- LGL compared to CD3+ LGL, although the response was augmented in the latter cells by prior rosetting with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Calcium mobilization in CD3- LGL induced by CLB/FcR gran I is associated with inhibition of natural killer cell (NK) killing, and inhibition of the enhanced NK killing induced by the anti-CD2 low-density monoclonal antibody, 9.1. This supports the view that the NK-enhancing activity of 9.1 is due to simultaneous binding to CD2 and CD16, and may in fact be transduced through the CD16 molecule. The variable reported effects of anti-CD16 antibodies on NK killing are likely to reflect the epitope bound rather than the isotype of antibody used, since F(ab')2 fragments of CLB/FcR gran I also inhibit NK killing.},

	abstract = {Nitric oxide has been implicated in mechanisms mediating nerve-evoked vasodilatory and secretory responses in salivary glands. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-immunoreactive nerves in ferret and rat salivary glands were investigated using immunocytochemistry with rabbit and sheep NOS antisera, and using NADPH-diaphorase enzyme histochemistry. In the parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands of the rat and the ferret, NOS-immunoreactive varicose terminals encircled acini and arteries of various sizes. In the ferret, collecting ducts were also supplied with NOS-immunoreactive fibres. In the rat, only the granular ducts of the submandibular gland were supplied with such fibres. The NOS-immunoreactive innervation of acinar cells was more abundant in the rat than in the ferret, whereas the opposite was true for the innervation of blood vessels. No NOS immunoreactivity was observed in the vascular endothelium. In both species, NOS-positive ganglionic cell bodies were found in the hilar regions of the submandibular and sublingual glands, whereas none could be detected in the parotid glands. NADPH-diaphorase reactivity had the same neuronal distribution as NOS immunoreactivity and, in addition, NADPH-diaphorase reactivity was expressed in ductal epithelium. Neither sympathetic denervation (by removal of the superior cervical ganglion) nor treatment with the sensory neurotoxin capsaicin reduced the NOS-immunoreactive innervation of the parotid gland. However, parasympathetic denervation (by cutting the auriculo-temporal nerve) caused an almost total disappearance of the NOS-immunoreactive innervation. The present findings provide a morphological background to the suggested role of nitric oxide in parasympathetic secretory and vascular responses of salivary glands.},

	abstract = {An antiserum directed against the human form of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was utilized for immunohistochemical visualization of the distribution of this peptide in the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellum of 2 monkey species (Saimiri sciureus, Macaca fascicularis). Colchicine pretreatment was not used. In both species, immunoreactivity was evident in the vast majority of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, with perikarya in the medial accessory olive exhibiting especially intense staining. In cerebellum, no labeled perikarya were present, but immunoreactive axons exhibiting the morphological characteristics of climbing fibers and their collaterals were observed in cortical and nuclear structures. In the cortex, most labeled axons were confined to the molecular and Purkinje cell layers. In the sagittal plane, individual axonal arbors originated from thick, isolated axons at the base of the molecular layer and repeatedly ramified as they extended toward the cortical surface. In coronal sections, only thin, paired profiles were present. Labeled processes also formed efflorescences in the granular layer of cortex and were evident as highly arborized axons in cerebellar nuclei. In each of these instances, the labeled elements resembled climbing fibers or their collaterals as visualized by other methods. Other labeled processes in the granular layer exhibited the morphological characteristics of mossy fiber axons. Immunoreactive, climbing-fiber-like axons were present in the molecular layer throughout the major regions of cerebellar cortex. However, the most intensely labeled of these axons were strikingly clustered within particular regions and parasagittal domains. In the vermis and intermediate zone, intensely labeled axons were present only within parasagittal zones similar in location to those defined by climbing fiber innervation from the medial accessory olive. Intensely labeled axons were also densely but uniformly distributed within the uvula, the medial region of the dorsal paraflocculus, and the dorsal region of the pyramis, areas that receive their climbing fiber input primarily from the medial accessory olive. Labeled fibers were much less dense and were not clustered in the lateral hemispheres. The present observation of CRF-like immunoreactivity in the monkey olivocerebellar pathway is compatible with the previous observation of CRF mRNA within olivary neurons of rat, baboon, and human (Young et al., 1986) and with recent immunohistochemical findings in rat (Sakanaka et al., 1987; Palkovits et al., 1987), cat (Cummings et al., 1988; Kitahama et al., 1988), sheep (Cummings et al., 1988), and human (Powers et al., 1987).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {A subpopulation of HNK-1+ cells was found to express interleukin 2 receptor (IL 2R) as monitored by the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody after lectin or allogeneic cell stimulation. When blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A for 3 days, or with pokeweed mitogen or allogeneic mononuclear cells for 6 days, virtually all of the HNK-1+ cells remained as small resting lymphocytes. One-fourth of these HNK-1+ cells expressed IL 2R, however, usually within 18 hr after stimulation. Neither circulating HNK-1+ cells nor unstimulated HNK-1+ cells in short-term culture expressed IL 2R. Only the subset of HNK-1+ cells that expressed T cell surface markers, such as the sheep erythrocyte receptor and Leu-4 antigen, could be induced to express IL 2R. When long-term cultures of HNK-1+ cells were established with initial PHA stimulation and the continued presence of IL 2, a majority of the cells was found to express the IL 2R. When anti-Tac antibody was added to the long-term cultures, proliferation of the HNK-1+ cells was completely inhibited. These results suggest that entry into growth cycle by this subpopulation of HNK-1+ granular lymphocytes may require two signals: a relatively nonspecific ligand interaction with cell surface glycoprotein(s) to induce expression of IL 2R, and subsequent IL 2 interaction with these specific cell surface receptors.},

This protein has subsequently been identified as the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP). 2. The 'novel' protein, with an apparent molecular weight of 18-22 kDa and a pI between 4.7 and 4.9, was isolated from enriched granular fractions of sheep kidney cortex using two-dimensional (2-D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following electroelution, the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined and, applying the preferred codon usage formula, an oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe was constructed for examination of sites of expression of this novel protein using northern analyses and hybridization histochemistry. 3. Western blots of the 2-D gels onto nitrocellulose membranes permitted us to select the appropriate spots for injection into rabbits for production of polyclonal antibodies. The antibodies were used to confirm the sites of protein production using immunohistochemistry. 4. Northern analyses revealed that GM2AP mRNA has a widespread distribution in ovine tissues. In the kidney, GM2 was expressed in all major renal arteries and arterioles. In the liver, the expression of the gene was prominent in the hepatic vein and ducts. Antibodies raised against the GM2AP confirmed that the protein was present at the same sites as the mRNA. 5. These are the first studies showing the location of GM2 activator gene expression in normal mammalian tissues. The arterial site of production has implications for local action or an important role in membrane integrity throughout the kidney.},

Recent studies indicate that human basophils also produce IL-4, although direct proof is missing so far. In this study we demonstrate the presence of IL-4 in the cytoplasm of in vitro activated human peripheral blood basophils derived from normal donors. Cytokine-producing cells were revealed at the single-cell level by intracellular immunofluorescence staining using IL-4-specific monoclonal antibodies. Basophils showed a characteristic, apparently granular staining pattern easily discerned from the eccentric dot-shaped staining pattern in activated T cells used in control experiments. Cell counts following priming with IL-3 and stimulation with polyclonal sheep anti-IgE antibody or the anaphylatoxin C5a revealed a significant increase in IL-4-positive basophils to about 19\% as compared with unprimed, unstimulated control cells (6\%). The amount of IL-4 in the supernatant of these cell preparations paralleled these observations with an at least five- to sevenfold increase following stimulation as compared with control cells ({\textless} 5 ng/ml). Using confocal scanning laser microscopy, the intracellular presence of IL-4 was confirmed, and the cells were identified as being basophils on terms of their characteristic multilobed nucleus. This observation was supported by double labeling studies using antibodies to IL-4 and to the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon R1). Interestingly, stimulation of cells led to a decrease in the number of Fc epsilon R1-positive cells. The above results show direct evidence that IL-4 is produced by activated human basophils.},

Cell membrane-bound IgG sterically blocks the reaction of LGL with sheep red blood cells and therefore influences the proportions of these cells characterized as TG (E+) or L (E-) lymphocytes. Although the majority of TG lymphocytes are LGL, a further subpopulation of E+, Fc gamma R+ cells are detectable under particular test conditions. Unlike LGL, these lymphocytes do not react with rabbit IgG-coated ox RBC (EAG) in saline, but will form EAG rosettes when the reaction is enhanced in the presence of Ficoll. These Fc gamma R+ cells are mostly of typical small-lymphocyte morphology and do not bind detectable amounts of CYT-Ig, nor do they express the monoclonal antibody-defined VEP 13 determinant associated with Fc gamma R on LGL.},

In contrast, the adjacent absorptive epithelium demonstrated strong reactions for these enzymes. Carbonic anhydrase gave a strong reaction at the luminal and apparent basolateral cell borders of the large intestinal FAE. This distribution of reactivity for carbonic anhydrase resembled that found in the ileal FAE. In absorptive epithelial cells, only the luminal cell border reacted strongly for carbonic anhydrase. Serial sections of large intestinal tissue showed a variation in the basolateral staining of FAE from one section to the next, a finding which suggested that the reaction may be associated with transcytosis.

	issn = {0021-9258},
	abstract = {The current study was done to test the hypotheses that parafollicular granules contain a vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) similar to that found in chromaffin granules, that the transport of H+ into granules mediated by this enzyme drives the granular uptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and that secretagogues stimulate both the acidification of parafollicular granules and their ability to take up 5-HT by opening an anion channel in the granular membrane. Our studies indicate that parafollicular granules contain a V-ATPase that is antigenically similar to that of the V-ATPase of adrenal chromaffin granules; however, the parafollicular granular membrane differs from that of chromaffin granules in permeability to Cl- and K+. The membranes of granules derived from resting parafollicular cells appear to be relatively impermeable to Cl- but permeable to K+. Parafollicular granules (and ghosts derived from them) manifest ATP-dependent transmembrane transport of 5-HT. This transport is more dependent on the pH difference (delta pH) than on the membrane potential component of the proton electrochemical gradient across the granular membrane. Transport of 5-HT is thus inhibited more by exposure of parafollicular granules to agents, such as nigericin, that collapse delta pH than by those, such as valinomycin, that decrease transmembrane difference in potential. ATP-dependent uptake of 5-HT by granules isolated from secretagogue-stimulated parafollicular cells is greater than that into granules isolated from unstimulated cells. Since secretagogues open a Cl- channel in parafollicular granule membranes, which enhances acidification of the granules, the facilitation of 5-HT uptake by secretagogues is probably due to an increase in delta pH.},

	abstract = {Notch signaling is probably the most widely used intercellular communication pathway. The Notch mutant in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was isolated about 100 years ago at the dawn of genetics. Since then, research on Notch and its related genes in flies, worms, mice, and human has led to the establishment of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, the Notch signaling pathway. In the past few decades, molecular cloning of the Notch signaling components as well as genetic, cell biological, biochemical, structural, and bioinformatic approaches have uncovered the basic molecular logic of the pathway. In addition, genetic screens and systems approaches have led to the expansion of the list of genes that interact and fine-tune the pathway in a context specific manner. Furthermore, recent human genetic and genomic studies have led to the discovery that Notch plays a role in numerous diseases such as congenital disorders, stroke, and especially cancer. Pharmacological studies are actively pursuing key components of the pathway as drug targets for potential therapy. In this chapter, we will provide a brief historical overview of Notch signaling research and discuss the basic principles of Notch signaling, focusing on the unique features of this pathway when compared to other signaling pathways.

	abstract = {Notch signaling is probably the most widely used intercellular communication pathway. The Notch mutant in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was isolated about 100 years ago at the dawn of genetics. Since then, research on Notch and its related genes in flies, worms, mice, and human has led to the establishment of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, the Notch signaling pathway. In the past few decades, molecular cloning of the Notch signaling components as well as genetic, cell biological, biochemical, structural, and bioinformatic approaches have uncovered the basic molecular logic of the pathway. In addition, genetic screens and systems approaches have led to the expansion of the list of genes that interact and fine-tune the pathway in a context specific manner. Furthermore, recent human genetic and genomic studies have led to the discovery that Notch plays a role in numerous diseases such as congenital disorders, stroke, and especially cancer. Pharmacological studies are actively pursuing key components of the pathway as drug targets for potential therapy. In this chapter, we will provide a brief historical overview of Notch signaling research and discuss the basic principles of Notch signaling, focusing on the unique features of this pathway when compared to other signaling pathways. Further studies to understand and manipulate Notch signaling in vivo in model organisms and in clinical settings will require a combination of a number of different approaches that are discussed throughout this book.},

	abstract = {YAP and TAZ are ubiquitously expressed homologous proteins originally identified as penultimate effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway, which plays a key role in maintaining mammalian tissue/organ size. Presently, it is known that YAP/TAZ also interact with various non-Hippo signaling pathways, and have diverse roles in multiple biological processes, including cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cell lineage fate determination, tumorigenesis, and mechanosensing. In this review, we first examine the various microenvironmental cues and signaling pathways that regulate YAP/TAZ activation, through the Hippo and non-Hippo signaling pathways. This is followed by a brief summary of the interactions of YAP/TAZ with TEAD1-4 and a diverse array of other non-TEAD transcription factors. Finally, we offer a critical perspective on how increasing knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of YAP/TAZ signaling might open the door to novel therapeutic applications in the interrelated fields of biomaterials, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and synthetic biology.},

	doi = {10.1093/genetics/151.4.1531},
	abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation. Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene. Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely. Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.
